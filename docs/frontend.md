# Frontend

The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that create the user interface for browsing the archived Gists.

## Key Components

-   **`index.html`**: The main entry point that displays the list of all Gists.
-   **`assets/js/tags.js`**: A script that provides dynamic, client-side filtering of Gists by tags.
-   **`assets/js/highlight.min.js`**: A third-party library (highlight.js) used for syntax highlighting of code snippets within the Gist pages.
-   **`assets/css/style.css`**: Custom styles for the website.

## Tag Filtering (`tags.js`)

The `tags.js` script enhances the user experience by allowing users to filter the list of Gists without reloading the page.

### How It Works

1.  **Initialization**: When the page loads, the script scans the page for Gist entries and their associated tags.
2.  **UI Creation**: It dynamically creates a filter input field and a display area for the active filter.
3.  **Tag Extraction**: It finds tags within the Gist list items. The Go backend ensures tags from the Gist description (e.g., `#go #logs`) are present in the HTML. The script makes these tags clickable.
4.  **Local Filtering**: When a user clicks a tag or types in the filter box, the script performs a local search through the Gist data it has already collected from the DOM.
5.  **DOM Manipulation**: It shows or hides Gist entries in the list based on whether they match the filter query. This is done entirely on the client-side, making the filtering feel instantaneous.

This approach provides a fast and responsive way to navigate Gists, especially when the number of archived Gists is large.
# Frontend Documentation

This document details the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up the user-facing website for browsing the archived gists.

## 1. Overview

The frontend is a simple, static website generated by the Go backend. It is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to navigate. It consists of:
- An `index.html` page listing all gists.
- Individual HTML pages for each gist.
- Shared CSS for styling and JavaScript for client-side interactivity.

## 2. File Structure

The generated frontend assets are organized as follows:

```
/assets
  /css
    /highlights       # Syntax highlighting themes
    styles.css        # Main stylesheet
  /js
    filter.js         # Logic for filtering the gist list
    highlight.min.js  # Highlight.js library
    notes.js          # Logic for styling GitHub-style notes
    tags.js           # Logic for tag-based filtering
index.html            # The main landing page
/gists
  <gist-id>.html      # Individual pages for each gist
```

---

## 3. HTML Pages

### `index.html`

This is the main entry point. It contains:
- A header and a title.
- A text input field for filtering gists by title, date, or tags.
- An unordered list (`<ul>`) where each list item (`<li>`) is a link to an individual gist page. Each entry displays the gist's title, creation date, and any associated tags.

### Gist Pages (`gists/<gist-id>.html`)

Each gist has its own HTML page. These pages contain:
- A "Back to Index" link.
- The rendered Markdown content of the gist, including formatted text and syntax-highlighted code blocks.
- Special styling for GitHub-style alerts (e.g., `[!NOTE]`, `[!WARNING]`).

---

## 4. CSS (`assets/css/styles.css`)

The main stylesheet provides a clean, responsive design inspired by GitHub's UI. Key features include:
- A fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
- Styling for code blocks (`<pre>`, `<code>`) to ensure readability.
- Custom styling for GitHub-style alerts, giving them distinct colors and icons based on their type (Note, Tip, Warning, etc.).

---

## 5. JavaScript (`assets/js/`)

The frontend uses minimal, vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.

### `filter.js`

This script adds an event listener to the search input on `index.html`. When the user presses "Enter", it filters the list of gists in real-time by hiding any entries that do not match the search query. The search is case-insensitive and matches against the gist's title, date, and tags.

### `tags.js`

This script enhances the user experience for tag-based filtering on `index.html`:
- It dynamically converts plain text tags (e.g., `#go`) into clickable links.
- When a tag link is clicked, it filters the gist list to show only gists containing that specific tag.
- It displays the currently active tag filter and provides a "Clear" link to reset the view.

### `notes.js`

On individual gist pages, this script scans the rendered Markdown for blockquotes that start with GitHub's alert syntax (e.g., `> [!NOTE]`). It then wraps these blockquotes in `<div>` elements with appropriate CSS classes to apply the custom alert styling defined in `styles.css`.

### `highlight.min.js`

This is the minified Highlight.js library, which is used for client-side syntax highlighting of code blocks on the individual gist pages.
