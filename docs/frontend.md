# Frontend Documentation

This document details the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up the user-facing website for browsing the archived gists.

---

## 1. Overview

The frontend is a simple, static website generated by the Go backend. It is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to navigate. It consists of:
- An `index.html` page listing all gists.
- Individual HTML pages for each gist.
- Shared CSS for styling and JavaScript for client-side interactivity.

## 2. File Structure

The generated frontend assets are organized as follows:

```
/assets
  /css
    /highlights       # Syntax highlighting themes
    styles.css        # Main stylesheet
  /js
    lunr.min.js       # Lunr.js search library
    search.js         # Logic for client-side search using Lunr.js
    highlight.min.js  # Highlight.js library
    notes.js          # Logic for styling GitHub-style notes
    tags.js           # Logic for tag-based filtering
index.html            # The main landing page
/gists
  <gist-id>.html      # Individual pages for each gist
```

## 3. HTML Pages

### `index.html`

This is the main entry point. It contains:
- A header and a title.
- A text input field for searching gists by title, date, or tags.
- An unordered list (`<ul>`) where each list item (`<li>`) is a link to an individual gist page. Each entry displays the gist's title, creation date, and any associated tags.

### Gist Pages (`gists/<gist-id>.html`)

Each gist has its own HTML page. These pages contain:
- A "Back to Index" link.
- The rendered Markdown content of the gist, including formatted text and syntax-highlighted code blocks.
- Special styling for GitHub-style alerts (e.g., `[!NOTE]`, `[!WARNING]`).

---

## 4. CSS (`assets/css/styles.css`)

The main stylesheet provides a clean, responsive design inspired by GitHub's UI. Key features include:
- A fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
- Styling for code blocks (`<pre>`, `<code>`) to ensure readability.
- Custom styling for GitHub-style alerts, giving them distinct colors and icons based on their type (Note, Tip, Warning, etc.).

---

## 5. JavaScript (`assets/js/`)

The frontend uses minimal, vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.

### `search.js`

This script implements a powerful client-side search for the gists listed on `index.html`.
- It uses the Lunr.js library to provide full-text search capabilities.
- The search supports advanced features like word stemming and prefix matching, making it easy to find relevant gists even with partial or related terms.
- It uses a pre-built search index (embedded as a JavaScript variable `window.SEARCH_DATA` in `index.html`) generated by the Go backend to initialize Lunr.js.
- As the user types in the search box, it filters the list of gists in real-time, hiding entries that do not match the query.

### `tags.js`

This script enhances the user experience for tag-based filtering on `index.html`:
- It dynamically converts plain text tags (e.g., `#go`) into clickable links.
- When a tag link is clicked, it populates the search box with that tag and triggers the search, filtering the gist list to show only gists containing that specific tag.

### `notes.js`

On individual gist pages, this script scans the rendered Markdown for blockquotes that start with GitHub's alert syntax (e.g., `> [!NOTE]`). It then reconstructs these sections into new, styled `<blockquote>` elements with the appropriate CSS classes to apply the custom alert styling defined in `styles.css`.

### `highlight.min.js`

This is the minified Highlight.js library, which is used for client-side syntax highlighting of code blocks on the individual gist pages.
