## Quick Fastly Logging Endpoint in Terminal.md

Whenever I need logging and can't be bothered to spin up infrastructure, I like to set up a log endpoint on my machine using ngrok and nc:

Ngrok:

```bash
ngrok tcp 514
# point logging to 0.tcp.ngrok.io:SOMEPORT
```

Netcat:

```bash
nc -lkv 514 
# logs straight to your terminal
```
