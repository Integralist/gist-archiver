## Adverbs

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, noun phrase, clause, preposition, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as how?, in what way?, when?, where?, and to what extent?.

## Verb Types

Read more about verb types [here](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/about-verbs/verbs-types).

### Main Verbs

Main verbs have meanings related to actions, events and states. Most verbs in English are main verbs: 

- We **_went_** home straight after the show.
- It **_snowed_** a lot that winter.
- Several different types of volcano **_exist_**.

### Linking Verbs

Some main verbs are called linking verbs (or copular verbs). These verbs are not followed by objects. Instead, they are followed by phrases which give extra information about the subject. These include: appear, feel, look, seem, sound, be, get, remain, smell, taste, become.

- A face **_appeared_** <u>at the window</u>. It was Pauline. (prepositional phrase)
- He **_'s_** <u>a cousin of mine</u>. (noun phrase)
- This coat **_feels_** <u>good</u>. (adjective phrase)
- She **_remained_** <u>outside</u> while her sister went into the hospital. (adverb phrase)

> Also: I _**am**_ a teacher. I _**turned**_ green.

In the original sentence:

> They are driving a red car down the road but very slowly.

The word "are" is a state/linking verb, and "driving" is an action verb.

### Auxiliary Verbs

There are three auxiliary verbs in English: be, do and have. Auxiliary verbs come before main verbs.

#### Auxiliary Be

Auxiliary be is used to indicate the continuous and the passive voice:

- I **_’m waiting_** for Sally to come home. (continuous)
- Her car **_was stolen_** from outside her house. (passive)

#### Auxiliary Do

Auxiliary do is used in interrogative, negative and emphatic structures:

- **_Does_** she live locally? (interrogative)
- They **_didn’t_** know which house it was. (negative)
- I **_do_** like your new laptop! (emphatic, with spoken stress on do)

#### Auxiliary Have

Auxiliary have is used to indicate the perfect:

- I **_'ve lost_** my memory stick. **_Have_** you **_seen_** it anywhere? (present perfect)
- She **_had seen_** my car outside the shop. (past perfect)

### Modal Verbs

Modal verbs have meanings connected with degrees of certainty and necessity, such as: can, may, must, should, would, could, might, shall, will.

- We **_'ll_** be there around 7.30. (speaker is quite certain)
- A new window **_could_** cost around £500. (speaker is less certain)
- I **_must_** ring the tax office. (speaker considers this very necessary)

## Present Tense

### Continous

There are some similarities between state/linking verbs and what is known as 'Present Continous Tense', which is a means of describing a _subject_ along with a _present tense_ for the verb to be. For example, "I am swimming" ("I" is the subject, "am" is the present tense for the verb to be, and "swimming" is the present verb).

There are other forms of present continuous tense (verb tense is italicized):

- She _is crying_.
- We _are visiting_ the museum in the afternoon.
- You _are not watching_ the movie.

It can also indicate if something will or will not happen in the near _future_:

- She _is not going_ to the game tonight.
- _Are_ you _visiting_ your cousin this weekend?
- I _am not going_ to the meeting after work.
- _Is_ John _playing_ football today?

### Perfect

The present tense (i.e. not continuous) is a means of describing an event that happened in the past that has present consequences.

- She _has lived_ here all her life.
- He has finished his homework (_has done_).
- I _have worked_ here since I graduated school.

Present perfect tense can be used with expressions that are unspecific in time:

- I have lost my purse.
- We have seen this movie already.
- He has broken his leg.
- There has been an accident.

## Inflection

Inflection is the name for the extra letter or letters added to nouns, verbs and adjectives in their different grammatical forms. Nouns are inflected in the plural, verbs are inflected in the various tenses, and adjectives are inflected in the comparative/superlative.

### Examples

- bus → buses  
- wish → wishes
- easy → easiest
- carry → carrying
- play → played
- die → dying
- stop → stopped
- happen → happening
