## git commit template example file.md

- Commit your file
- `git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>`
- Allow changes using: `git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>`

This only works when user executes the command.

So you'll need to add a note to the repo's README and maybe make it easy by abstracting within a Makefile:

```make
lock_local_file:
  git update-index --assume-unchanged ./some/file.json
```
