## Sync Pool.go

```go
// http://www.akshaydeo.com/blog/2017/12/23/How-did-I-improve-latency-by-700-percent-using-syncPool/

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// Pool for our struct A
var pool *sync.Pool

// A dummy struct with a member 
type A struct {
	Name string
}

// Func to init pool
func initPool() {
	pool = &sync.Pool {
		New: func()interface{} {
			fmt.Println("Returning new A")
			return new(A)
		},
	}
}

// Main func
func main() {
	// Initializing pool
	initPool()

	// Get hold of instance one
	one := pool.Get().(*A)

	one.Name = "first"

	fmt.Printf("one.Name = %s\n", one.Name)

	// Submit back the instance after using
	pool.Put(one)

	// Now the same instance becomes usable by another routine without allocating it again
  	//
    // Note: depending on the data type in your pool, you might want to make sure that you
    // zero out the data in the object before putting it back into the pool.
    //
    // An example of this would be a complex/expensive object creation for user authentication.
    // But putting back a user object with a username/password would be bad as the next request
    // would pull those values out of the pool.
    //
    // Meaning, if you use the pool for reducing the overhead of recreating objects, then that's
    // fine but just be aware of making the pool dirty by putting back stateful objects.
}
