## zsh.md

## Path replacement

Moving from:
`/www/site1/media/css/main`
to
`/www/site2/media/css/main`
can be a pain, but not in zsh:

```sh
cd site1 site2
```


## Globbing to find / remove files

Find all pdf files recursively 

```sh
ls **/*.pdf
```

Find all files bigger than 10M

```sh
ls **/*(.Lm+10)
```

For more examples type `ls **/*(` then `tab`

## Jump to previous directories

Enter `dirs -v`. You should see all the directories from your history stack.

You can use cd to navigate between its entries:
```
cd +4
```

## Change directories without cd

With auto_cd, no need for `cd`

```sh
cd a_directory
# can be replaced with:
a_directory
```

## Mass rename with zmv

```sh
zmv -W '*.txt' '*.markdown'
```
