## css-touch-delay.md

Although it's possible to extend the above optimisation approach to `checknavigator.maxTouchPoints` and to then hook up our listener to `pointerup` rather than `click`, there is a much simpler way: setting the [`touch-action` CSS property](http://www.w3.org/Submission/pointer-events/#the-touch-action-css-property) of our element to `none` eliminates the delay.

```css
/* suppress default touch action like double-tap zoom */
a, button {
    -ms-touch-action: none;
        touch-action: none;
}
```
