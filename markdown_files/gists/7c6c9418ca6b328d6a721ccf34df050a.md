## Problem

Consider the following example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	for _, n := range []int{1, 2, 3, 4} {
		fmt.Printf("%#v | %d\n", &n, n) // NOTE: The memory address is the same! Meaning the value could change and print 4 each time.
	}
}
```

Static analysis tools (like `gosec`) will sometimes report:

> G601: Implicit memory aliasing in for loop. (gosec)

This happens because in [for statements](https://golang.org/ref/spec#For_statements) the iteration variable is reused. 

This means for each iteration, the _value_ of the next element in the `range` expression is assigned to the iteration variable. 

So `v` doesn't change, only its _value_ changes. Hence, the expression `&v` is referring to the _same location in memory_.

When you store the address of the iteration variable, or when you use it in a closure inside the loop, by the time you dereference the pointer, its value might have changed.

## Solutions

> **NOTE:** Go _might_ fix this in go1.22 (not guaranteed at time of writing).

Index the ranged slice/array/map. This takes the address of the actual element at i-th position, instead of the iteration variable:

```go
for i := range versions {
    res := createWorkerFor(&versions[i])
}
```

Reassign the iteration variable inside the loop:

```go
for _, v := range versions {
    v := v
    res := createWorkerFor(&v) // this is now the address of the inner v
}
```

With closures, pass the iteration variable as argument to the closure:

```go
for _, v := range versions { 
    go func(arg ObjectDescription) {
        x := &arg // safe
    }(v)
}
```
