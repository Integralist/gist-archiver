## Vim Tips.md

- `:windo set scrollbind` and `:windo set cursorbind` to make two windows scroll together.
- `gf` takes you to the file referenced (e.g. `[Makefile](../Makefile)`) but if you add a `:` followed by a line number to the link (e.g. `[Makefile](../Makefile:123)`) then pressing `gF` will take you to the specific line number as well.
- `:-d` and `:+d` delete the line above or below the current line, unlike `dj` or `dk` which would also delete the current line.
- `:copy` allows you to copy a line to another location (e.g. `:10 copy 20` copies the range, in this case line 10, to _below_ line 20), where I had always `:10y` then moved to the destination).
- `:<range>put <register>` allows you to paste a register to a specific line.
- `:packadd cfilter` enables filtering results from quickfix window (e.g. `:Cfilter /pattern/`, also has negated version `Cfilter!`).
- To 'append' to multiple lines: `Ctrl+v` and select multiple lines, then `$`, then `Shift+a` and start typing (this is the opposite of 'insert' with `Ctrl+v` and `Shift+i`).
- To autoformat text to a specific width (e.g. `set textwidth=80`), first select the text and then execute `gq`. This is super useful for when you have a code comment that you need to tweak/edit, and then it messes up the line breaks. You can just select the entire text and `gq` to have it fixed!
- `:%!jq` will format the entire file
- modelines (https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#modeline)
  - Markdown: `<!-- vim: set colorcolumn=57,80: -->`
  - Go: `// vim: foldmethod=indent foldlevel=0`

```shell
vim -E -s config.txt <<-EOF
:%s/foo/bar/
:update
:quit
EOF
```
