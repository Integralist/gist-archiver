## Vim Tips.md

## Make two windows scroll together

`:windo set scrollbind` and `:windo set cursorbind`

## Go to file and line number

`gf` takes you to the file referenced (e.g. `[Makefile](../Makefile)`) but if you add a `:` followed by a line number to the link (e.g. `[Makefile](../Makefile:123)`) then pressing `gF` will take you to the specific line number as well.

## Delete line above or below the current line

`:-d` and `:+d` delete the line above or below the current line, unlike `dj` or `dk` which would also delete the current line.

## Copy line to another location

`:copy` allows you to copy a line to another location

e.g. `:10 copy 20` copies the range, in this case line 10, to _below_ line 20), where I had always `:10y` then moved to the destination.

## Paste a register

`:<range>put <register>` allows you to paste a register to a specific line.

## QuickFix Window Filtering

`:packadd cfilter` enables filtering results from quickfix window (e.g. `:Cfilter /pattern/`, also has negated version `Cfilter!`).

## Append to multiple lines

To 'append' to multiple lines: `Ctrl+v` and select multiple lines, then `$`, then `Shift+a` and start typing (this is the opposite of 'insert' with `Ctrl+v` and `Shift+i`).

## Format text width

To autoformat text to a specific width (e.g. `set textwidth=80`), first select the text and then execute `gq`. This is super useful for when you have a code comment that you need to tweak/edit, and then it messes up the line breaks. You can just select the entire text and `gq` to have it fixed!

## Format JSON with jq

`:%!jq` will format the entire file

## Modelines

https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#modeline

- Markdown: `<!-- vim: set colorcolumn=57,80: -->`
- Go: `// vim: foldmethod=indent foldlevel=0`

## Edit files via terminal

```shell
vim -E -s config.txt <<-EOF
:%s/foo/bar/
:update
:quit
EOF
```

## Sort All Arrays

This uses `:g/regex1/,/regex2/command` syntax.

`:g/\[/+1,/\]/-1sort`

It will operate on all lines between the lines matching `/regex1/` and `/regex2/` 

We use this to sort a bunch of arrays in a file that looked like:

```
some_var = [
  one,
  two,
  three,
]

another_var = [
  pineapple,
  banana,
  apple,
]
```
