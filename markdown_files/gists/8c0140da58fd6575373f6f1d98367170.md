## difference between URL host and Request Header Host.md

The `r.URL` field is created by parsing the HTTP request URI.

The `r.Host` field is the value of the `Host` request header. It's the same value as calling `r.Header.Get("Host")`.

If the HTTP request on the wire is:

```
GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org:8080
```

...then `r.URL.Host` is `""` and `r.Host` is `www.example.org:8080`.

The value of `r.URL.Host` and `r.Host` are almost always different. 

On a proxy server, `r.URL.Host` is the host of the target server and `r.Host` is the host of the proxy server itself. 

When not connecting through a proxy, the client does not specify a host in the request URI. In this scenario, `r.URL.Host` is the empty string.

If you are not implementing a proxy, then you should use `r.Host` to determine the host.
