## Topics to discuss with a new employer.md

## Questions to ask yourself?

- What's _important_ to me (what are my priorities and standards)?
- What impact can _I_ have here?

## Questions for them?

It's a good idea, at the start of any conversation, to ask:

> What's the focus of today's conversation?  

i.e. What's important to `<COMPANY>`, and what insights do _you_ want to take from this?

- **What's `<COMPANY>`'s story?**  
  - Give me an insight into the company's history/background and how we've reached this point in time.

- **Presence**  
  - How many offices do you have and what are their locality?

- **Culture and Diversity**  
  - The company's "values" will help indicate what's _important_ to them.

- **Hierarchy and Organisation Structure**
  - Are you fairly 'flat and lean' or 'tall and fragmented'?

- **Visibility & Openness**
  - How does leadership share and handle critical/internal business topics?

- **Collaboration**
  - Features across teams (avoiding duplication)
  - Timezones

- **Community**
  - How do internal & external staff interact?
  - How do teams across offices/locality bond?

- **Process**
  - New Features
  - Leadership
  - Documentation (sharing of information, no silos of knowledge)
  - Post mortems (blameless retrospection, handling of failures)
  - Tech Debt

- **Communication**
