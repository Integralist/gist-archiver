## Choosing a Good Name

A name has two goals:

1. It needs to be _clear_: you need to know what the name refers to.
2. It needs to be _precise_: you need to know what it does not refer to.

After a name has accomplished those goals, any additional characters are dead weight.

## Tips

Here are some tips to help you...

- Omit words that are obvious given the type (e.g. ❌ `var fooString string`).
- Omit words that don't disambiguate the name (e.g. ❌ `finalMostDangerousMonster` vs ✅ `boss`).
- Omit words that are known from the surrounding context (e.g. ❌ `class HolidaySale: _HolidayRebate = 123`).
- Omit words that don't mean much of anything (e.g. ❌ `class WaffleObject` vs ✅ `class Waffle`).
