## CPU bound vs IO bound.md

- **CPU bound**: the rate at which a process progresses is limited by the speed of the CPU. 
- **I/O bound**: the rate at which a process progresses is limited by the speed of the I/O subsystem.

This means a task that performs calculations on a small set of numbers, for example multiplying small matrices, is likely to be CPU bound. While a task that processes data from disk, for example, counting the number of lines in a file is likely to be I/O bound.

A program is CPU bound if it would go faster if the CPU were faster.

A program is I/O bound if it would go faster if the I/O subsystem was faster.
