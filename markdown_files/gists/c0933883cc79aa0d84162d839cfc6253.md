## Populate (or update) pkg.go.dev with new package.md

## Add

If you want a project to appear in https://pkg.go.dev then visit the expected page and click on the "Request ..." button.

e.g.

```
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/integralist/go-flags
```

I clicked on the button "Request github.com/integralist/go-flags" and it started to populate.

## Update

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fastly/go-fastly/v3@main

or 

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fastly/go-fastly/v3@v3.8.0 (and there should be a button that will show letting you pull the version specified).

Or yet another way is:

https://sum.golang.org/lookup/github.com/fastly/go-fastly/v3@v3.8.0
