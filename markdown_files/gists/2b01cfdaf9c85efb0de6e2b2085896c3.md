Vim doesn't handle stdin like other posix commands...

```bash
$ echo foo | vim

Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal
Vim: Error reading input, exiting...
Vim: Finished.
```

If you pass `-` to vim, then it will accept the stdin and copy it to a new buffer...

```bash
$ echo foo | vim -
```

Before we look ahead at how to handle stdin a bit better, let's consider the `+` flag which tells vim what line to start on (the following example tells vim to jump to line 10):

```bash
$ vim ~/.vimrc +10
```

This will become relevant when we look at two other flags `-e` and `-s` (see `vim -h` for more information on available flags)...

```bash
$ echo foo | vim - -es +'%p' +'qa!'

Vim: Reading from stdin...
foo
```

When using the `-e` and `-s` flags, we're able to use `+` to execute Ex mode commands (see `:help -s-ex`).

> Note: if you don't use `+'qa!'` then vim will cause the terminal to hang (you also need the `!` otherwise `qa` would -- if dealing with a traditional vim UI -- show a message saying the buffer has been edited and can't be quite).

To avoid the `Vim: Reading from stdin...` message we need an additional flag `--not-a-term`:

```bash
$ echo foo | vim - -es +'%p' +'qa!' --not-a-term

foo
```

So now if we want to manipulate the content (let's say uppercase the word `foo` to `FOO`) we can do:

```
$ echo foo | vim - -es --not-a-term +'norm VgU' +'%p' +'qa!'

FOO
```

> Note: `norm` says execute the following characters as if the user is typing them, so `V` selects the entire line and `gU` uppercases the selection. We then print the output to stdout `%p` and then quit without trying to save the modifications.
