## Example.md

Create a new user (using an API token that has 'superuser' permissions):


```bash
curl -v -H "Fastly-Key: $FASTLY_API_TOKEN_SUPERUSER" -X POST -d "name=Foo Bar&login=foo.bar%40example.com" https://api.fastly.com/user
```

Response (notice no 2FA, no password, no force password reset etc):

```json
{
  "id":"001",
  "created_at":"2019-04-16T13:32:41Z",
  "updated_at":"2019-04-16T13:32:41Z",
  "name":"Foo Bar",
  "customer_id":"123",
  "require_new_password":false,
  "role":"user",
  "login":"foo.bar@example.com",
  "deleted_at":null,
  "locked":false,
  "two_factor_auth_enabled":false,
  "limit_services":false,
  "email_hash":"456",
  "two_factor_setup_required":true
}
```

Set our own initial password for the user:

```bash
curl -v -H "Fastly-Key: $FASTLY_API_TOKEN_SUPERUSER" -X POST -d "new_password=foobar" https://api.fastly.com/user/<id>/password
```

Response (notice `require_new_password` is set to `true` now we've set a password for the user):

```json
{
  "id":"001",
  "created_at":"2019-04-16T13:32:41Z",
  "updated_at":"2019-04-16T13:51:38Z",
  "name":"Foo Bar",
  "customer_id":"123",
  "require_new_password":true,
  "role":"user",
  "login":"foo.bar@example.com",
  "deleted_at":null,
  "locked":false,
  "two_factor_auth_enabled":false,
  "limit_services":false,
  "email_hash":"456",
  "two_factor_setup_required":true
}
```

When signing in with this user, they are forced to setup 2FA. The concern at this point, is that this user is able to log into the Fastly UI and start creating both READ and WRITE API tokens for _any service_. Meaning, we should probably create the user but never set a password and see if we can still create API tokens for that user's account and have them be usable to query the Fastly API.

In order to create a new token for a user account, we first need to call a `/sudo` endpoint:

```bash
# don't forget to escape any special characters with a backslash \
export ADMIN_PASS=123456

curl -v -H "Fastly-Key: $FASTLY_API_TOKEN_SUPERUSER" -H "Fastly-OTP: 123456" -X POST -d "username=admin@example.com&password=$ADMIN_PASS" https://api.fastly.com/sudo
```

You can then request the token creation:

```bash
curl -H "Fastly-Key: $FASTLY_API_TOKEN_SUPERUSER" -X POST -d "username=<user>&password=<pass>&services[]=<service>" https://api.fastly.com/tokens
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id":"000",
  "name":"Fastly API Token",
  "user_id":"123",
  "service_id":"456",
  "expires_at":null,
  "created_at":"2019-04-16T15:10:16Z",
  "updated_at":"2019-04-16T15:10:16Z",
  "scope":"global",
  "services":["<service_id>"],
  "access_token":"<a_new_token>"
}
```

> Note: this token is generated for the superuser, and unfortunately not the specified username in the post formdata (which is what we wanted). Doesn't matter what creds you provide at this point. As you used the superuser account for `/sudo` it means the token will be setup for that user. This means as don't _know_ anything about our user's or their creds (or OTP codes), we won't be able to create API tokens on their behalf.

## Fastly Create Users + API tokens for Auditing purposes.md

> Note: the following was a brief 'step-by-step' provided by Fastly.

First, we create the user: 

```
https://docs.fastly.com/api/account#user_00b606002596bac1c652614de98bd260
``` 

Because we can’t create the user with an specific password, we manually update the recently created user’s password with this API call:

```
POST /user/<user-id>/password
Authentication: Using the API key of a superuser. Send that API key using the Fastly-Key header.
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Payload: The new password should be sent as formdata within the field new_password
```

Then, knowing the user and password, we can create a personal token: 

```
https://docs.fastly.com/api/auth#tokens_db4655a45a0107448eb0676577446e40
```

I’d also finish by requesting a password reset for the user, so they can set whatever they want: 

```
https://docs.fastly.com/api/account#user_cee4dbb44c07d9ed078424cbbd353e1a
```
