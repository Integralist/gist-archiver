## Vim highlighting words.md

Vim can highlight certain words inside of code comments, such as...

- `BUG` (Golang)
- `FIXME`
- `NOTE`
- `NOTES` (Python)
- `TODO`
- `XXX`

> The `NOTE` works in both Go and Python files and yet it's not defined in the Go syntax file, which means it's likely inherited from a default syntax file.

See the syntax files for...

- [Python](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/a87b72cc316e065d66dcbcf7ec1cde330adef3a3/runtime/syntax/python.vim#L134)
- [Go](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/a87b72cc316e065d66dcbcf7ec1cde330adef3a3/runtime/syntax/go.vim#L95)

You can add your own, see [this StackOverflow post](https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/15531) for the full details, but in summary it looks something like:

```vim
augroup myTodo
  autocmd!
  autocmd Syntax * syntax match myTodo /\v\_.<(TODO|FIXME).*/hs=s+1 containedin=.*Comment
augroup END

highlight link myTodo Todo
```
