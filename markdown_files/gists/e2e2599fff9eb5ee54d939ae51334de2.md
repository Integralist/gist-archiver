```shell
# note: have to double escape the \ for the regex operator +
# + means "one or more occurrences", but in vim you need to escape it \+
# but in execute mode you need to escape the escape as \ is a special character in execute mode

# this didn't work...
#
# :execute "normal gg/upstream .\\+ {\<cr>mq"
# :execute "normal 'qI\<cr>\<esc>"
# 
# nor...

# :execute "normal gg/upstream .\\+ {\<cr>O"

vim -E -s site_router/nginx_rendered_dev.conf <<-EOF
:execute "normal gg=G"
