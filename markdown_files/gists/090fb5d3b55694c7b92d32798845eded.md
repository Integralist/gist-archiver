## Backup all your GitHub Gists (inc. private gists).md

## Instructions

- Install this gem: https://github.com/swdyh/gisty
- Create a new access token in GitHub: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  - You only need the `gist` box ticked, nothing else necessary
- Set this: `export GISTY_DIR="$HOME/path/where/you/want/gists/saved"`
- Set this: `export GISTY_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxx`
- Run this: `gisty sync`

...now sit and wait for it to start cloning all your gists into the specified directory

> Use `ls -l | wc -l` to count how many gists you have

## Caveats

The cloned gists are placed inside folders named after the gist ID so it's not exactly clear what a folder is.

You can obviously try and search through your gists using something like:

```bash
function search_gists(){
  local search=*$1*
  find . -name $search
}

search_gists docker
search_gists aws
```

But remember that this is for local backups and not a replacement for GitHub's Gist service
