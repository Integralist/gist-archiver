# Grouping AND along with OR statement

(message:"ERROR" OR message:"WARN") AND (-message:"placeholder")

# Match anything except: GET /

* AND -message:"GET /"

# Match error logs "E," but ignore those that include "Failed Headline Fetch" or "GET /" or "INFO"

message:"E," AND -message:"Failed Headline Fetch" AND -message:"GET /" AND -message:"INFO"

# Specify a timeframe

message:"E," AND -message:"Failed Headline Fetch" AND @timestamp: [2015-06-11T10:00:00 TO 2015-06-11T21:00:00]
