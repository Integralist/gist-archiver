## How to write an introduction well Inbox.md

```markdown
A _hook_ is any half-told story:

- **Questions**: Pose an intriguing question, but donâ€™t give the answer.
- **Narratives**: Share the beginning of a narrative, but withhold the conclusion.
- **Discoveries**: Highlight new findings, but only a portion.
- **Arguments**: Present your case, but not how you arrived at it.
