```text
Below the skin of history are London’s veins. 

These symbols, the mitre, the pentacle star, 
even to someone as ignorant and degenerate as you 
can sense that they course with energy ...and meaning. 

I am that meaning. 
I am that energy. 

One day, men will look back and say that I gave birth to the 20th Century.

- Jack The Ripper
