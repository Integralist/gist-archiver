## Jack The Ripper.txt

```text
Below the skin of history are Londonâ€™s veins. 

These symbols, the mitre, the pentacle star, 
even to someone as ignorant and degenerate as you 
can sense that they course with energy ...and meaning. 

I am that meaning. 
I am that energy. 

One day, men will look back and say that I gave birth to the 20th Century.

- Jack The Ripper
