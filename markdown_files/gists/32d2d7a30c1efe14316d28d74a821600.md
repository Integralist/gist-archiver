1.2k = 1.2 * 1000 = 1,200  
0.15k = 0.15 * 1000 = 150

^^ can help understand a value such as 'E notation' `2.9e-4` (which equates to `0.00029`, i.e. `2.9 * (10/10/10/10)` and the `10/10/10/10` is another way of saying 10 to the _negative_ power of 4 which is called 'logarithm' `10-4`).

Number Notation (inc. metric prefixes, such as `G` for giga and `M` for mega):  
http://math2.org/math/general/numnotation.htm

- `4G` == `4,000,000,000`
- `4M` == `4,000,000`

Commas `,` are used to make reading the numbers easier. They _are not_ supposed to represent 'decimal' places. 

If decimals were included then a number such as `4G` would look more like `4,000,000,000.00`.

If you saw the number `42.68G` then this really means: `42,000,000,000.68` (_NOT_: `42.68000000000`).

If you saw the number `1.03K`(K stands for kilo, meaning thousand) then this really means: `1,030` (e.g. `1.03*1000`).

Below is a dashboard that demonstrates this. See the blue line is higher up the y axis which indicates the number is larger, while the red line is a lot lower...

In that image we can also see the 'average' value for the red line is `302.99M` which means `302,000,000.99`. That number is a lot smaller than the average reported for the blue line, which is `42.68G` (as that's `42,000,000,000.68`).
