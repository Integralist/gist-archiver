## The problem with Terraform's schema.TypeSet.md

Set elements are viewed as opaque values that are added/removed. 

If any elements "change", then the set's "identity" has changed. 

The contents of the set is hashed, and so the changing of the content results in the set _as a whole_ needing to be recreated.

This is why if you update a field inside a `schema.TypeSet` in Terraform, and you run a `terraform plan` you'll see the entire resource marked as needing to be deleted and recreated.
