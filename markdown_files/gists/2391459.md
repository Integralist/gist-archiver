# Relative Sizing

## Description.md

If you set the `<body>` element to have `font-size: 100%` then you are effectively setting the pixel size base line to be `16px`.

So now `1em` equals `16px`.

To size either our text or our layouts to match what the designer has specified in pixels we use the following calculation:

`target / context = result`

This means if your target font size for a `<h1>` is 24px and your 'context' (the container) is 16px then you calculate this as:

`24 / 16 = 1.5`

So you set your font size to `1.5em`.

Same for a layout. If the designer has made the website `960px` wide and has an element within it that is `900px` wide. 

First thing to do is to set the `960px` width to be a percentage. Well we have to just take a guess on this I'm afraid so we'll choose 90%.

But thankfully to turn `900px` into a percentage we can use the previous calculation of `target / context = result` again:

`900 / 960 = .9375`

But now (as you're using percentages for your layout) you move the decimal over two places: `93.75%`
