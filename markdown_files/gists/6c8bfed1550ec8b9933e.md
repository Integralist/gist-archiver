# Netcat

## Netcat.md

Install the netcat `nc` command with Homebrew (otherwise Mac OS X version is really old and the interface is different):

```bash
brew install netcat
```

Use netcat to listen for incoming TCP connections on port 3000:

```bash
nc -l -p 3000
```

> Note: old versions of netcat consider using `-l` and `-p` incorrect usage  
> e.g. this would work instead for old versions of netcat `nc -l 3000`

This instance of netcat is considered a "listener" and is now waiting for a connection. 

Once you connect to the listener, the connection will act like a channel/pipe.

Use netcat to establish a TCP connection (run in a new terminal window so as to not conflict with listening netcat instance):

```bash
nc localhost 3000
```

You've set up both ends of the TCP connection. If you type into one of those terminal windows and hit `<Enter>`, you should see whatever you typed appear in the other window. Any data put through one end of the pipe will appear at the other end of the pipe.

Execute `<Ctrl-c>` to stop both netcat instances.

Now, to send a HTTP request we'll need two terminal windows again. In the first we'll again be listening on port 3000:

```bash
nc -l -p 3000
```

But this time in the other terminal window we'll use `curl` to send a HTTP request to our `localhost:3000` that netcat has set-up:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

Now in the listening netcat terminal window simply type the following HTML code, then press `<Enter>` (that's important, it doesn't work otherwise) and then stop the netcat instance by executing `<Ctrl-c>` to see the HTML response sent back to the other terminal window where you made the initial `curl` request (you can do this in your browser as well if you want to see the HTML actually rendered):

```bash
<h1>hello world</h1>
```

If you try this from both the terminal and from a proper browser request, you'll notice a slight difference between sending a `curl` request and sending a HTTP request from your browser:

**curl request**:

```bash
GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: curl/7.37.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:3000
Accept: */*
```

**browser request**:

```bash
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:3000
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
