# Vim Grep

## Vim Grep.md

```markdown
## Standard Vim Grep

Basic syntax structure:

```viml
:vimgrep  /<searchTerm>/[gj] </path/to/project/**/*.rb>
:lvimgrep /<searchTerm>/[gj] </path/to/project/*>
```

> Note: `j` prevents Vim from trying to open the first file match

Example usage (we're searching for any reference to `class` anywhere in the project):

```viml
:vimgrep /class/gj **/*
:copen
```

> Note: `copen` will open Vim's "quick fix" window

## Using an alternative search tool

Vim provides a `:grep` command, which allows you to utilise a custom search program. 

The default program it uses can be seen by running:

```viml
:set grepprg
```

Which should return:

```viml
grepprg=grep -n $* /dev/null
```

Configuring Vim to use another program (e.g. [Sift](https://sift-tool.org/))

```viml
:set grepprg=sift\ -n\ -X\ log\ --binary-skip\ $*
```

> Note: spaces have to be escaped with a backslash `\`

You can now use the new program like so (e.g. to find any reference to the word `class` using Sift):

```viml
:grep class
:copen
```

> Note: you still need to open the quick fix window afterwards to utilise the results
```
