Log commits in `feature` branch that aren't in `master`:

```bash
git log master..feature
```

If you `git pull` your `master` branch you might find there are additional commits from your colleagues. So you might want to check what commits were recently merged into `master` that aren't in your `feature` branch:

```bash
git log feature..master
```

The triple dot range will show you all the git commits that aren't common to both branches. 

Imagine we have a `master` branch with the commits `A, B`. We create the `feature` branch and add `C, D` commits. Then we go back to `master` and add `E, F` commits. In this scenario both branches have `A, B` commits, but diverge from there. The following log example will report `C, D, E, F` because these commits aren't common to both branches:

```bash
git log master...feature
```
