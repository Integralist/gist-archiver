## chmod explained.md

```
r - Read
w - Write
x - Execute

u - The owner of the file
g - The group that the file belongs to
o - Anybody who is not one of the above
a - All users

+ - Add permissions
- - Remove permissions
```

Syntax Structure:

```bash
chmod <people><+/-><permissions>
```

Examples:

- `chmod o-w`: deny others from editing the file
- `chmod u+rwx` give the owner full control
- `chmod +rwx` give everyone full control
- `chmod +x` allow anyone to execute the file

Numericals:

```bash
chmod 755
```

Each number represents a different authorisation point...

- `7`: owner
- `5`: group
- `5`: everyone else

Each item is the total of the following numbers...

- `4`: read
- `2`: write
- `1`: execute

So `755` means...

- `7`: read, write and execute for the owner
- `5`: read and execute for the group
- `5`: read and execute for everyone else

## chown explained.sh

```shell
chown <user>:<group> <file>
```
