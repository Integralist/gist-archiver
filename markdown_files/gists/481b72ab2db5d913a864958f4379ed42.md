# Redirect stdout and stderr

## redirect stdout and stderr.md

- File descriptor 0 is the standard input (`stdin`).  
- File descriptor 1 is the standard output (`stdout`).  
- File descriptor 2 is the standard error (`stderr`).

Example redirection(s)...

```bash
docker ps 1> /dev/null 2>&1
```

The above example will redirect `stdout` (1) to `/dev/null`.

It then redirects `stderr` (2) to wherever `stdout` is pointing.

At first, `2>1` may look like a good way to redirect `stderr` to `stdout`. However, it will actually be interpreted as "redirect stderr to a file named 1". `&` indicates that what follows is a file descriptor and not a filename. So the construct becomes: `2>&1`.
