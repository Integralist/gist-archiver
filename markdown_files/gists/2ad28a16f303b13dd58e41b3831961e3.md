When using go modules I've stumbled across this error a few times, but it's infrequent enough for me to spend hours _each_ time trying to recall how to fix it.

```
malformed module path ... missing dot in first path element
```

This occurs when I'm using the `replace` directive in a go.mod file to tell the go compiler that anytime it sees a custom import like `foo/bar` to actually lookup that code from somewhere locally available to the application.

e.g.

```
module github.com/buzzfeed/mono/rate_control

go 1.14

require (
	buzzfeed/instrumentation v0.0.0
	buzzfeed/settings v0.0.0
	github.com/go-redis/redis v6.15.7+incompatible
	github.com/go-redis/redis/v7 v7.2.0
	github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.4.1
)

replace (
	buzzfeed/instrumentation => ./shared/lib/instrumentation
	buzzfeed/settings => ./shared/lib/settings
)
```

So the problem with the above is that I import `buzzfeed/instrumentation` and that itself is a go module that imports `buzzfeed/logging` and `buzzfeed/metrics`.

In `buzzfeed/instrumentation`'s go.mod file it also uses `replace` to change the lookup of those dependencies.

The source of the `malformed module path` error is actually misleading.

The actual problem is documented in the golang wiki: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#when-should-i-use-the-replace-directive (specifically the first paragraph under the linked section):

> As described in the 'go.mod' concepts section above, replace directives provide additional control in the top-level go.mod for what is actually used to satisfy a dependency found in the Go source or go.mod files, **_while replace directives in modules other than the main module are ignored when building the main module_**.

This means that my top-level go.mod file, although it doesn't directly use `buzzfeed/logging` or `buzzfeed/metrics`, still needs the 'replace' directives to be added.

For example, the following fixes it...

```diff
module github.com/buzzfeed/mono/rate_control

go 1.14

require (
	buzzfeed/instrumentation v0.0.0
	buzzfeed/logging v0.0.0
	buzzfeed/metrics v0.0.0
	buzzfeed/settings v0.0.0
	github.com/go-redis/redis v6.15.7+incompatible
	github.com/go-redis/redis/v7 v7.2.0
	github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.4.1
)

replace (
	buzzfeed/instrumentation => ./shared/lib/instrumentation
+	buzzfeed/logging => ./shared/lib/logging
+	buzzfeed/metrics => ./shared/lib/metrics
	buzzfeed/settings => ./shared/lib/settings
)
```
```
