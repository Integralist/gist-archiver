# [OpenAPI feature flags use different schemas] #schemas #openapi #api #design

## README.md

```markdown
I don't know if this actually works but apparently you can use a [discriminator](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/#discriminator) like this...

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, your API has to return a `type` property that might have a value like `"base"` or `"feature_x"`.

If the API response contains `"type": "base"`, then the OpenAPI schema will use the `BaseResponse` schema. 
Otherwise, if it's `"type": "feature_x"`, the OpenAPI schema will use the `eatureXResponse` schema.
