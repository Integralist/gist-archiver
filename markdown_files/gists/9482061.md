# Download a single file from a private GitHub repo. You'll need an access token as described in this GitHub Help article: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use

## GitHub curl.sh

```shell
curl --header 'Authorization: token INSERTACCESSTOKENHERE' \
     --header 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' \
     --remote-name \
     --location https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo/contents/path

# Example...

TOKEN="INSERTACCESSTOKENHERE"
OWNER="BBC-News"
REPO="responsive-news"
PATH="scripts/build/tabloid.sh"
FILE="https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/contents/$PATH"

curl --header 'Authorization: token $TOKEN' \
     --header 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' \
     --remote-name \
     --location $FILE
```

## options.md

- `-H --header` Extra header to use when getting a web page. You may specify any number of extra headers

- `-O --remote-name` Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get (only the file part of the remote  file  is  used, the path is cut off)

- `-L --location`  If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different  location  (indicated  with  a Location:  header  and a 3XX response code), this option will make curl redo the request on the new place
