To SCP [go-wrk](https://github.com/tsliwowicz/go-wrk) onto a server for executing (this is if you can't be bothered to bake a version of go-wrk into the application RPM):

- Generate the binary (`GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build` from directory where source code is located)
- SSH into the Cosmos instance and create an empty file (e.g. `cd /app && touch go-wrk`)
- From your local machine SCP the Linux binary of go-wrk (e.g. `scp -v </path/to/go-wrk> mark_mcdonnell@<ip>,eu-west-1:/app/`)
- From remote machine move the binary to an accessible path (e.g. `mv go-wrk /usr/bin/`)
- Then set the mode (e.g. `chmod 755 /usr/bin/go-wrk`)

> or instead you could copy the file into `/home/mark_mcdonnell`

## scp-remote-to-local.sh

```shell
# Execute the following command from your local machine
scp -v -r mark_mcdonnell@10.6.6.149,eu-west-1:/app/ /Users/M/Projects/Foo/Bar
```
