## Exceptions

If you know a function raises an exception, then you can catch and assert against it by using `pytest.raises`

```python
with pytest.raises(exceptions.CognitoException) as exc_info:
        app.account.confirm(123, 'foo')
        
assert exc_info.typename == 'CognitoException'
assert str(exc_info.value) == 'SIGNUP_CONFIRMATION_FAILED'
```

## Capturing Output

Some functions (such as a command-line tool) only produce side effects (e.g. _output_) and don't necessarily _return_ a value to the caller. In order to test these types of functions Pytest let's us capture their output.

```python
def test_my_function(capsys):
    my_function()  # function that prints stuff
    captured = capsys.readouterr()  # Capture output
    assert f"Received invalid message ..." in captured.out  # Test stdout
    assert f"Fatal error ..." in captured.err  # Test stderr
```

Pytest provides a fixture called `capsys`, which captures system output. All you need to use it, is to add it as parameter to your test function. Next, after calling function that is being tested, you capture the outputs in form of tuple `(out, err)`, which you can then use to `assert` against. 

> Note: you can't use this on a `tornado.testing.AsyncHTTPTestCase`.

## Parametrize

You can use a table matrix to cause a test to be re-run multiple times with the same input arguments, but with different input _values_:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input, output", [
    ("1234", True),
    ("12345", True),
    ("foo/bar1_baz2-qux3.beep", False),
    ("<bad_stuff>", False),
    ("/<bad_stuff>", False),
])
def test_valid_video_id(input, output):
    assert valid_video_id(input) is output
```

> Note: mock decorators come _before_ the pytest decorator (also you can't use parametrize on a `tornado.testing.AsyncHTTPTestCase`).
