## High Availability Content and Resilient Systems with Redundancy.md

- Encourage greater use of existing shared software libraries (e.g. those that implement 'graceful shutdown' for in-flight requests).
- Create shared libs supporting resilience patterns (e.g. circuit breakers, back-off, retries).
- Monitor dependencies and identify new releases, notifying service owners/channels (allow frequency control).
- More flexible canary deployments and introduce [blue-green deployments](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html).
- Utilize tools such as [Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/) or [Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/).
- Improve our synthetic testing (e.g. smoke testing).
- Better service isolation (e.g. prevent problems propagating to other parts of our system). 
- Create feature flags to help disable broken features within a service quickly.
- Automatic failover to multiple regions † (remove the manual process for app-west).
- Implement some form of ‘adaptive capacity’ adjustment (software and infrastructure).
- [Prioritized load shedding](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/using-load-shedding-to-survive-a-success-disaster-cre-life-lessons&sa=D&ust=1578937508830000&usg=AFQjCNE3hdPlc8GprCexIrXHOXKL-Mq7gA) (effective caching might be simpler/easier).
- Setup 'traffic mirroring' (which can help verify service performance for dark launches).

> † Software libraries might need updating to reflect the dynamic nature of the regions they're interacting with.
