## valid url path.md

A [path segment](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3) (the parts in a path separated by `/`) in an absolute URI path can contain zero or more of _pchar_ that is defined as follows:

```
pchar       = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"
unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
pct-encoded = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
sub-delims  = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
```

So it’s basically `A–Z`, `a–z`, `0–9`, `-`, `.`, `_`, `~`, `!`, `$`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `;`, `=`, `:`, `@`, as well as `%` which must be followed by two hexadecimal digits (`0-9` and `A-F`). Any other character/byte needs to be encoded using the percent-encoding.
