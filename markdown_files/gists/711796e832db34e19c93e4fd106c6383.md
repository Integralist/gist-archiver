## CRDT. conflict-free replicated data type.md

Operations on CRDTs need to adhere to the following rules:

- Associativity `(a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c)`, so that grouping doesn't matter.
- Commutativity `(a+b=b+a)`, so that order of application doesn't matter.
- Idempotence `(a+a=a)`, so that duplication doesn't matter.

Data types as well as operations have to be specifically crafted to meet these rules. CRDTs have known implementations for counters, registers, sets, graphs, and others.
