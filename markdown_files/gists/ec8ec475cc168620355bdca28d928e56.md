## PHP - setup Composer with local code.md

## Install Composer
- macOS comes with php version 7.3.24
- Download composer ([instructions](https://getcomposer.org/download/)) and move binary to your `$PATH`
- Create a new project directory (e.g. `~/path/to/your/code/project`)
- Run `$ composer init` and select the 'project' package type.

### Debugging

For debugging use https://github.com/tacnoman/dephpugger (e.g. `composer require tacnoman/dephpugger`). 

You'll need `xdebug` too, which has to be installed via `pecl` and _that_ is only available on PHP when installed via macOS Homebrew. 

Also, with latest version of xdebug you'll find some properties have been updated and so until there is a newer version of dephpugger that supports xdebug 3 you'll have to manually update `vendor/tacnoman/dephpugger/src/Dephpug/Console/CliCommand.php` with renamed fields (see https://xdebug.org/docs/errors#CFG-C-CHANGED and the upgrade guide for details).

The summary of those changes being:

```diff
- $command = "{$configVar} {$phpPath} -dxdebug.remote_enable=1 -dxdebug.remote_mode=req -dxdebug.remote_port={$debuggerPort} -dxdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1 {$phpFile}";
+ $command = "{$configVar} {$phpPath} -dxdebug.mode=debug -dxdebug.start_with_request=trigger -dxdebug.client_port={$debuggerPort} -dxdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1 {$phpFile}";
```

Now you can open three shells:

1. In your code add `xdebug_break();` where necessary.
2. Start the debugger server: `$ php vendor/bin/dephpugger debugger`.
3. Run your code using the debugger's `cli` client: `$ php vendor/bin/dephpugger cli main.php`.

## Set local code as a project dependency

```bash
$ cd ~/path/to/local/package
$ git init
$ echo -e "vendor\ncomposer.lock" > .gitignore
$ git add ./
$ git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```

Ensure the local package's `composer.json` file has a `name` key defined with an appropriate value, as you'll need to reference that shortly.

Now go back to your project directory and update the `composer.json` to reference the local package code as a dependency:

```json
{
    â€¦
    "require": {
        "foo/bar": "dev-main"
    },
    "repositories": [{
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "/path/to/local/package"
    }]
}
```

> **NOTE**: The `dev-` prefix inside the `require` block denotes a development branch, where typically a semver value (like `1.0.0`) would otherwise be required.
