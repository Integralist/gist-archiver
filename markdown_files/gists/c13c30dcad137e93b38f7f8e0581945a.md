## nginx rate limiting is weird.md

```markdown
nginx rate limiting is weird

it takes input in requests per second

but thatâ€™s not how it rate limits

instead it divides your limit into tenth of a second chunks

so a rate limit of 10 req/s is actually 1 req / 0.1 s

which means if you get 2 requests within 0.1 s, the second one will be rejected

the best way to mitigate this is to allow a burst (this is what we do on webapp_waf) where you allow a burst of e.g. 10 reqs - meaning the first 10 requests wont be limited, but then if that rate is sustained future ones will be limited based on the tenth of a second bucketing
```
