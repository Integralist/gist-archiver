# AWK: extract first changelog entry #awk #changelog

## extract-first-changelog-entry.md

We want just the 'v1.0.0-beta.2' changelog block, not 'v1.0.0-beta.1'...

```
# Changelog

```

The following awk script does this for us...

```shell
cat CHANGELOG.md | awk '/^##/{block++} {if (block==1) {print}}'
```

Awk works by reading the input 'line by line'. Our script checks if the conditional pattern `^##`  matches, which is the start of the changelog entry, and if so it increments the variable `block`. Next, it checks the variable value and prints each line as long as the variable is equal to `1`. 

The moment we reach the next changelog entry, the `block` variable will be incremented to `2` and so the block that prints each line will not execute.
