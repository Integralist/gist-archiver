## Panic vs os.Exit.md

`panic` signals "the programmer has made a fundamental mistake and execution cannot continue safely", whereas `os.Exit` signals "the programmer has decided that the process should terminate here" â€” different meanings. Also, important difference in behavior: `panic` will unwind the callstack, which means it will call any pending `defer` statements; `os.Exit` will just do a hard kill, so it won't.
