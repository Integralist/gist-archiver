## Year in Review 2014.md

Looking back at what I achieved this year...

- I published two books with Apress:
  - [Pro Vim](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-Vim-Mark-McDonnell/dp/1484202511/ref=sr_1_1)
  - [tmux Taster](http://www.amazon.co.uk/tmux-Taster-Mark-McDonnell/dp/1484207769/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1)
- Worked on BBC News Elections and Scottish Referendum back-end architecture and development with JRuby and AWS
- Organised public event with [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz) at [BBC New Broadcasting House](http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/)
  - Specifically getting a special thanks from Sandi in her opening story about her parents response to our invitation to speak at the BBC
- Co-designed and built cloud based distributed load test tool with [David Blooman](https://twitter.com/dblooman)
- Co-designed and built a CI workflow around static asset compilation with [Steven Jack](https://twitter.com/stevenjack85) and [Daniel Arnould](https://twitter.com/dan_arnould)
- Hacking on [Steven Jack](https://twitter.com/stevenjack85)'s excellent cloud tooling gem (built specifically for BBC)
- Having fun understanding the problem space of both concurrency and distributed systems design and implementation
- Became technical lead/principal engineer for the BBC News Frameworks team
  - But in reality that means nothing without an unbelievably solid team of extremely talented engineers to help make things happen:
    - [Steven Jack](https://twitter.com/stevenjack85)
    - [Daniel Arnould](https://twitter.com/dan_arnould)
    - [Charlie Revett](https://twitter.com/charlierevett)
    - [David Blooman](https://twitter.com/dblooman)
- Co-designed and built [Market Data](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/business/markets/europe/lse_ukx) back-end utilising the [Alephant Framework](https://github.com/BBC-News/alephant)
- Worked on updating the [Alephant Framework](https://github.com/BBC-News/alephant) example applications
  - Alephant was originally conceived by the massively talented [Robert Kenny](https://twitter.com/kenturamon)
- Working in an environment that (albeit slowly and not entirely perfected - e.g. no automated rollbacks) has reached a state of Continuous Delivery.
- Had fun playing with [Steven Jack](https://twitter.com/stevenjack85)'s great [Spurious](https://github.com/stevenjack/spurious) project 
  - Spurious is a toolset allowing development against a subset of AWS resources locally
- Co-designed a new version of BBC Newsbeat that is cloud based, distributed and utilising the [Alephant Framework](https://github.com/BBC-News/alephant)
- Won some awards:
  - Best Public Relations of the Year (for my books [Pro Vim](http://www.apress.com/9781484202517) and [tmux Taster](http://www.apress.com/9781484207765))
  - Most innovative use of Technology
    - I accepted this award for the BBC News Frameworks team, but in reality it is shared between both [Steven Jack](https://twitter.com/stevenjack85) and [David Blooman](https://twitter.com/dblooman) for their great contributions to tooling built around [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Currently building a Trello to JIRA (and vice-versa) AWS based application to help synchronise data between these two platforms
  - This is likely to be abstracted/generalised into an open-source project at some point in the future (as other organisations may find this type of tool useful)
- Very happy to be working within a team that challenges itself to investigate and re-evaluate its stance on specific programming techniques and principles. This is a very encouraging and motivational team and I'm proud to be a part of it.
