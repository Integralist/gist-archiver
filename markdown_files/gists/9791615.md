# Ruby: reducing context

[View original Gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/9791615)

## 1. too much context.rb

```ruby
class Dependency
  def initialize(foo, bar, baz)
    @foo = foo
    @bar = bar
    @baz = baz
  end

  def data
    { :foo => @foo, :bar => @bar, :baz => @baz }
  end
end

class Foo
  def initialize(Dep)
    @data = Dep.new(:a, :b, :c).data 
    # Foo knows too much about its dependency
    # Foo not only relies on the public interface,
    # but Foo also knows how to construct a new instance of the dependency;
    # that's too much knowledge (context)
    # So even though we're injecting our dependency, 
    # we're now tightly coupling Foo to the dependency 
  end
end

foo = Foo.new(Dependency)
```

## 2. less context.rb

```ruby
class Dependency
  def initialize(foo, bar, baz)
    @foo = foo
    @bar = bar
    @baz = baz
  end

  def data
    { :foo => @foo, :bar => @bar, :baz => @baz }
  end
end

class Foo
  def initialize(Dep)
    @data = Dep.data # Foo now only relies on an interface 
    # e.g. relies on being able to safely send a `data` message to the dependency
  end
end

foo = Foo.new(Dependency.new(:a, :b, :c))
```
