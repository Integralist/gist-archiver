I first create a `provider.tf` file.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    fastly = {
      source  = "fastly/fastly"
      version = "0.28.2"
    }
  }
}
provider "fastly" {
  api_key = "<API_KEY>"
}
```

Next I create a `main.tf` placeholder file (I name the resource `import_testing` but you will likely want to name it something different).

```terraform
resource "fastly_service_v1" "import_testing" {}
```

I use a program called `tfswitch` (https://github.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher) to manage multiple terraform versions, but you can just [download the latest version direct from HashiCorp](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) if you don't have multiple projects (e.g. each project using a different Terraform version).

I use `tfswitch` to install the latest version of Terraform (currently `v0.15.1`).

I run `terraform init` which displays a bunch of information, but the relevant section is in green and says "Terraform has been successfully initialized!"

I then import the service using:

```bash
terraform import fastly_service_v1.import_testing <SERVICE_ID>
```

Notice the use of `import_testing` as the name I assigned to the `fastly_service_v1` resource. If you decide to change the name as I suggested earlier, you will want to be sure to update this command to reflect that change. Also `<SERVICE_ID>` should be replaced with your actual Service ID.

Running this command will display some information, but the relevant section is in green and says "Import successful!".

I don't _need_ to run the next command, but I like to have a look at the local state straight after an initial import:

```bash
terraform show
```

The `show` subcommand pretty prints the internal Terraform state (i.e. what's in the `terraform.tfstate` that has been created in the local directory where the other Terraform files, `provider.tf`/`main.tf` are located).

The next crucial command is to run:

```
terraform show -no-color > main.tf
```

This will overwrite the 'placeholder' content that was in the `main.tf` file with a bunch of Terraform HCL code.

This code is a HCL version of the Terraform internal state, which will include a bunch of things that **_shouldn't_** be present in a typical Terraform file you would normally write manually by hand.

This means I need to manually edit the updated `main.tf` content so it doesn't include internal state attributes that would cause a `terraform plan` to get confused. I start by first executing `terraform validate` to be sure that otherwise Terraform is happy.

This should print the message "Success! The configuration is valid."

At this point I also run a `terraform plan` to see if Terraform thinks any changes are needed (I know from experience that Terraform will be confused and so I typically run this just out of interest).

I can see in the output (I've shortened it for brevity):

```diff
~ resource "fastly_service_v1" "import_testing" {
    + comment  = "Managed by Terraform"
    + vcl {
        + content = <<-EOT
    - vcl {
        - content = <<-EOT
        - main    = true -> null
        - name    = "customvcl" -> null
```

So we can see from this that it is seeing `comment` as a new attribute and the `vcl` attribute is being deleted and recreated.

So here's where I open up `main.tf` and manually remove attributes I know should be deleted (and add/modify certain attributes)...

**Attributes to delete**:
- `active_version`
- `id`

**Attributes to add**:
- `comment = ""` (I just added it under the `nameÂ = "<...>"` attribute).

**Attributes to modify**:
- `content` (inside the `vcl` block) should no longer use `<<-EOT` inlined VCL and should now become `content = file("vcl/main.vcl")`

That last point will require you to download your main VCL file and stick it inside a `vcl` directory next to your other Terraform files `provider.tf` and `main.tf`.

One other change I need to make is to the `terraform.state` file itself. I modify this file so that `"activate": null` becomes `"activate": true`. The `activate` field is specific to the Fastly Terraform Provider and is not returned by the Fastly API and so that's why we need to tweak it when doing an import of a service.

Although not used in this example, I've historically had to delete fields such as `dictionary_id`.

> **NOTE**: If you see any `(sensitive value)` values, then replace them with actual secrets (although it might be best to use `file()` for multi-line keys). You should have a read through Fastly's "[Orchestration using Terraform and the Fastly Terraform Provider](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/integrations/orchestration/terraform/)" which has a [best practices](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/integrations/orchestration/terraform/#best-practices) section that covers how to handle sensitive data.

Now if I run a `terraform plan` I'll see:

```
No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.
```
```

## Terraform Custom Diff Script.bash

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Explanation:
# I use this to help me identify when newlines are causing diff conflicts.

# Get plan
terraform plan -out=tfplan > /dev/null 2>&1

# Convert plan to json
CHANGES=$(terraform show -json tfplan | jq '.resource_changes[].change')

# Diff before and after with newlines expanded
diff -u \
  <(echo "$CHANGES" | jq '.before' | sed 's/\\n/\//g') \
  <(echo "$CHANGES" | jq '.after' | sed 's/\\n/\//g')
```
