## Software Simplicity.md

- Simplicity !== Easy
- Easy is short term and can sometimes even introduce complexity
- Simplicity allows for easy while avoiding complexity
- Complect == tangling/braiding together
- Complexity is the *result* of something that has been complected
- Untangle complected code (e.g. decoupling of components)
- Do not chain calls (i.e. Law of Demeter)
- Consider Channels as form of asynchronous flow control
- Ask yourself all the time: "can this *thing* be moved? does it have well defined boundaries?"
