Working code (Python 3.7+)...

```py
def sig_handler(server, sig, frame):
    io_loop = IOLoop.current()
    
    def stop_loop(deadline):
        now = time.time()
        if now < deadline and len(asyncio.all_tasks()) > 0:
            logging.info('waiting for next event loop tick')
            io_loop.add_timeout(now + 1, stop_loop, deadline)
        else:
            io_loop.stop()
            logging.info('event loop stopped')
            
    async def shutdown():
        logging.info('stop listening for new connections')
        server.stop()
        logging.info(f'stopping event loop in {SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT} seconds')
        # await server.close_all_connections() << don't use unless you WANT to kill all client connections immediately
        stop_loop(time.time() + SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT)
        
    io_loop.add_callback_from_signal(shutdown)
```

To recap what we had tried, that failed (iirc)...

- calling `tornado.httpserver.HTTPServer#close_all_connections`:  
  this wasn't documented, only found via source code  
  it didn't actually do _anything_ in Python 3.6 (even though its implemented? but it worked in later versions)  
  i.e. when not using a timeout it still didn't wait for the in-flight requests to complete

- checking timeout deadline and `io_loop._callbacks`/`io_loop._timeouts`:  
  this would have helped close the event loop sooner  
  but didn't work once we migrated to latest tornado as internal properties were deprecated  
  couldn't find alternative properties to rely on  
  either way I don't think we should rely on really old tornado versions

- use asyncio's event loop with `run_until_complete` and `shutdown_asyncgens`:  
  didn't work and I'm now not quite sure why.  
  at first it seemed like it was because tornado wraps the asyncio loop  
  and that maybe it was not exposing these methods directly  
  but the following calls all look to return the _same_ event loop instance...
    - `tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()`
    - `tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().asyncio_loop` << internally where asyncio loop is stored
    - `asyncio.get_event_loop()`

- I also tried updating to Python 3.8 so I could use `asyncio.all_tasks(loop=io_loop)`  
  this function should return all running tasks on the event loop.  
  each http request is a unique event loop 'task'  
  so if we shutdown while there are running tasks, they should be returned  
  unfortunately this just yielded an empty set data structure  
  the `io_loop` variable we pass to the constructor is a tornado event loop (which itself should be the underlying asyncio event loop)
  
- `all_tasks` works! but only if you omit the `loop` argument  
  this lets asyncio use `get_running_loop` to acquire the event loop

## 3. OLD CODE TESTING SCRATCH PAD -- Python Tornado Graceful Shutdown.py

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
How to use it:
1. Just `kill -2 PROCESS_ID` or `kill -15 PROCESS_ID`,
   The Tornado Web Server Will shutdown after process all the request.
2. When you run it behind Nginx, it can graceful reboot your production server.

> Note: the original version of this code didn't account for closing in-flight requests. There is a method (not documented other than sifting through the tornado source code for its HTTPServer class) that supposedly handles this, called `close_all_connections` but that doesn't seem to work when I tested it (not sure why :shrugs:). But the below version does try and account for checking internal properties `_callbacks` or `_timeouts` (which are only available for older versions of tornado, so the code doesn't work for version 5+).

See alternative approach (uses tornado.gen.sleep instead of ioloop ticks):
https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/1791#issuecomment-409258371

    async def shutdown():
        logging.info('Stopping http server')
        server.stop()
        await server.close_all_connections()
        logging.info('Will shutdown in %s seconds ...', SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT)
        await tornado.gen.sleep(SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT)
        ioloop.IOLoop.current().stop()
        
> Note: a lot of these examples are problematic or don't quite work due to the incompatible nature of tornado's IOLoop vs asyncio's. In Tornado version 5.0+ their IOLoop became a wrapper around asyncio's but even then they only expose a small number of methods that proxy to the underlying IOLoop, so methods like `run_until_complete` and `shutdown_asyncgens` (see below example) just don't work.

    def shutdown():
        logging.info('Stopping http server')
        server.stop()
        io_loop.run_until_complete(io_loop.shutdown_asyncgens())
        io_loop.close()

The following are all the same event loop instance...

- tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
- tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().asyncio_loop
- asyncio.get_event_loop()

## UPDATE

The best I've been able to achieve with latest tornado (6.0.3) is...

def sig_handler(server, sig, frame):
    io_loop = IOLoop.current()

    async def shutdown():
        logging.info('stop listening for new connections')
        server.stop()
        logging.info(f'stopping event loop in {SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT} seconds')
        await tornado.gen.sleep(SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT)
        io_loop.stop()
        logging.info('event loop stopped')

    io_loop.add_callback_from_signal(shutdown)
    
## UPDATE 2 -- BETTER SOLUTION

def sig_handler(server, sig, frame):
    io_loop = IOLoop.current()

    def stop_loop(deadline):
        now = time.time()
        logging.info(f'len(asyncio.all_tasks()): {len(asyncio.all_tasks())}')
        if now < deadline and len(asyncio.all_tasks()) > 0:
            logging.info('waiting for next event loop tick')
            io_loop.add_timeout(now + 1, stop_loop, deadline)
        else:
            io_loop.stop()
            logging.info('event loop stopped')

    async def shutdown():
        logging.info('stop listening for new connections')
        server.stop()
        logging.info(f'stopping event loop in {SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT} seconds')
        # await server.close_all_connections() << don't use unless you WANT to kill all client connections immediately
        stop_loop(time.time() + SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT)
