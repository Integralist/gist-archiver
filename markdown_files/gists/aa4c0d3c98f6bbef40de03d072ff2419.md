Best practice for making a change: 

1. If your TTL is X, then X units of time before you need to make a change, update TTL to 5 minutes. 

2. Now you can deploy your system change, then 5 minutes later it'll be available to your customers.

3. Finally, you can reset the TTL back to its original value.
