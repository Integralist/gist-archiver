# Git Patch and Apply (see alternative patch generation and applying in reverse: https://gist.github.com/Integralist/13d9f5e8ec197e5e53c6)

## 1. shorter version.bash

```shell
# presumes you're on a non-master branch with a set of changes that diff from `master`

# generate single patch file from multiple commits
git format-patch master --stdout > foobar.patch

# view stats on the patch file
git apply --stat foobar.patch

# test the patch without applying it (zero errors means the patch can be applied cleanly)
git apply --check foobar.patch

# apply and 'signoff' the patch (this is a different approach to `git apply`)
# 
# the new commit messages added to `master` will contain a “Signed-off-by” tag.
git am --signoff < foobar.patch
```

## Git Patch and Apply.md

```bash
git format-patch <base_branch_name>
```

Typically you'll specify `master`, as you'll be executing this command from your feature branch.

It'll generate a file for each new commit.

Use the following (`--stdout`) to get all new commits into a single patch file:

```bash
git format-patch master --stdout > new-feature.patch
```

The patch can then be applied like so:

```bash
git checkout review-new-feature
cat new-feature.patch | git am
```

or if you received multiple files:

```bash
cat *.patch | git am
```

Now you can check the result:

```bash
git log --oneline
```
