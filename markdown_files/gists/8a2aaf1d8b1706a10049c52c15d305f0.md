## vim linefeed and carriage return.md

> The term **CRLF** refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, `\r`) Line Feed (ASCII 10, `\n`). They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in today's popular Operating Systems.

- Windows: CRLF (`\r\n`)
- Linux/Unix: LF (`\n`)

Imagine in vim you have a buffer like:

```
a
b
c
d
```

If you wanted to add an extra line space between each line, so it looked like:

```
a

b

c

d


```

> Note: my example is based on me running Vim on macOS.

You would need to use a substitution like:

```viml
:%s/\n/\r\r/
```

Notice you're looking for a 'line feed' `\n` (because that's how macOS denotes a new line), while to get Vim to insert a line break I need it to _insert_ two separate 'carriage returns' `\r`.
