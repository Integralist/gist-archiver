# Vim: increment numbers across blocks #vim #increment

## Vim increment numbers across blocks.md

So I had an interesting problem where I had a block of code like... 

```
"testing0.testing-performance-domain.com" = {
  val1 = "value_1"
  ...
}
```

The ... is lots of key/value lines, so it ends up being a large 'block'.

I needed to duplicate the block multiple times (200 in fact) but the first line needed an incremented number, so...

```
"testing1.testing-performance-domain.com" = {
  val1 = "value_1"
  ...
}
"testing2.testing-performance-domain.com" = {
  val1 = "value_1"
  ...
}
"testing3.testing-performance-domain.com" = {
  val1 = "value_1"
  ...
}
```

The way I solved this was to:

- make sure the `"a` register contained `0`.
- `V%y` (copy the block).
- `199P` (duplicate it, as we need two hundred blocks).
- `qq` (on the first line of the first block I record the following macro `0f0v"ap^AvTg"ay`).
  - `0` go to start of the line.
  - `f0` find the first zero (e.g. the zero in `testing0`).
  - `v"ap` select the zero and replace it with the contents of the `"a` register (the first time round this would be the same number: `0`).
  - `^A` press Ctrl-a to increment the number pasted from the register.
    - The cursor is always placed at the end of the number.
    - So if number is 123 then the cursor would be on 3.
  - `vTg` select back to just before the `g` in the preceding word "testing" (i.e. select the new number).
  - `"ay` and yank the new number into the same `"a` register.
- I then reset the first block to zero (so `"testing0.testing-performance-domain.com" = {`)
- `:g/\v^\s\s\s\s"testing\d/norm @q` find all relevant blocks and run the macro.
