## go work.md

Create a new directory for your project.

Inside the directory `git clone` your projects.

Next, from within the project directory (where the individual projects are cloned _within_), create your `go.work` file.

You can do this in one of two ways:

```shell
go work init ./cli ./go-fastly
```

or

```shell
go work init 
go work use ./cli ./go-fastly
```

The latter is useful for changing the work file after you've started working.

You should end up with a file tree that looks something like this:

```
.
├── cli
│   ├── go.mod
├── go-fastly
│   ├── go.mod
├── go.work
├── go.work.sum
```

Now when you `cd` into one of the project directories (e.g. `cd ./cli`), and `go run` the code, you'll find it auto-magically identifies the dependency (e.g. `./go-fastly`) and uses that instead of trying to pull the remote/real dependency.
