# Homebrew: custom version install

[View original Gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/36dcf9fa921f6caa58990525e474d1a3)

## README.md

You can't install specific package versions using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

If you have a version installed you can _pin_ it:

```
brew pin <package>
```

That will prevent a `brew upgrade` from updating the package.

But this doesn't help if you've already upgraded a package and then discovered that you need an older version.

To do that:

1. Download the older Brew script, e.g. `helm` version `3.17.3`: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/14e5c24f9bb081fe3cd5ad595f518edc28955473/Formula/h/helm.rb
2. `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install /tmp/helm.rb`
