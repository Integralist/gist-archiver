## example.sh

```shell
echo -ne "Getting the TLS entries from 1Password... ⌛\r"
sleep 2  # Simulate some processing
echo -ne "Getting the TLS entries from 1Password... ✅\n"

# -n prevents echo from automatically adding a newline.
# -e enables interpretation of escape sequences like \r (carriage return).
# \r moves the cursor back to the start of the line, so the next echo overwrites it.
# The final \n ensures the cursor moves to a new line after displaying the ✅.
```
