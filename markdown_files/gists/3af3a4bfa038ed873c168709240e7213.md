## Well-Known URIs.md

`.well-known` is a standardized path on a website's root domain that allows services to access metadata and configurations related to that domain. It's defined by [RFC 5785].

The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) maintains a registry of [well-known URIs][wellknown], ensuring that these paths are standardized and avoid conflicts.
