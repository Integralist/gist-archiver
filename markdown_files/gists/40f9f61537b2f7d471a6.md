> I know I can go back the line and overwrite its contents with \r.  
Now how can I go up into the previous line to change that?

The basic solution involves: `\x1B[1F` (which effectively is an [ANSI Escape Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code): `Esc [ 1 F`)

But in context of a Ruby CLI script: `print "\r\x1B[1F\x1B[1F"`
