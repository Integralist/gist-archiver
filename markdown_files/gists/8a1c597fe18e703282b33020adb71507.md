# [Python3 pass vs ...]

## Python3 pass vs ....md

## Summary

- `pass`: use to indicate no-op.
- `...`: use to indicate code not yet implemented.

## Examples

If you had a function you were still in the process of writing, you might choose to use `...`

```python
def foo():
	...
```

If you were handling an exception and didn't want to do anything with it:

```python
deadline = time.time() + 10
deadline_passed = time.time() < deadline

while not deadline_passed:
    try:
        a_mock_object.assert_called()
        return
    except AssertionError:
        pass
```
