## 1. README.md

The Terraform Workspace feature only provides state isolation and is designed for testing out changes (synonymous with `git branch`).

HashiCorp provides [guidelines](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/workspaces.html#when-to-use-multiple-workspaces) on when to use the Terraform Workspace.

```bash
terraform init
terraform workspace new stage
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace list
terraform workspace select stage
```

> **NOTE**: you can't `terraform workspace delete default` so best to just ignore it, or treat it as your 'production' instead of creating a prod workspace.

## main.tf

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    fastly = {
      source  = "fastly/fastly"
      version = "0.27.0"
    }
  }
}

variable "backend" {
  type    = string
  default = "httpbin.org"
}

resource "fastly_service_v1" "service" {
  name = "Example Service"

  domain {
    name = "www.example.com"
  }

  backend {
    address = "${terraform.workspace}.${var.backend}"
    name    = "${terraform.workspace == "prod" ? "www" : "staging"}-httpbin"
  }

  force_destroy = true
}
```
