## Comprehensions

A comprehension is a fancy way of saying: "a more compact way of looping over, as well as filtering, a collection and generating a new collection from that process".

There are three types of 'comprehensions' in Python to align with the various 'collection' types:

1. List
2. Dict
3. Set

They all work the same but differ in the type that is generated at the end.

The syntax structure for each type looks like this:

```
# List
(values) = [ (expression) for (item) in (collection) if condition ]

# Dict/Set
(values) = { (expression) for (item) in (collection) if condition }
```

> Note: yes the Dict and Set syntax structure is the same but the output type will be different (as we'll see in the following examples) because the Dict will output key/value pairs, while the Set will output individual element values.

Here are examples of each...

```
# List Output:
# [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
[x * x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

# Set Output
# {0, 4, 16, 36, 64}
{x * x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}

# Dict Output
# {0: 0, 2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64}
{x: x * x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}
```

> Note: I've used the full syntax structure, but you don't have to. You could just use `for (item) in (collection)` and not include the `if condition` part.

If we were to write this code without comprehensions, then it would look like the following (yes it is a lot more verbose, but ultimately just a multi-lined version):

```
# List

output = []
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        output.append(x * x)

# Set 

output = set()
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        output.add(x * x)

# Dict

output = dict()
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        output.update({x: x * x})
```
