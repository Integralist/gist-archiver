If a method defines its receiver as being a pointer, then the caller of the method _ideally_ should pass a pointer as the receiver:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type foo struct{}

func (f *foo) bar() {
	fmt.Printf("bar called on %T\n", f)
}

func main() {
	f := &foo{}
	f.bar() // bar called on *main.foo
}
```

> Notice that we see `*main.foo` as the receiver was a pointer.

But as a convenience, the go compiler will automatically handle the passing of a pointer on behalf of the caller (in the case where they pass a value instead):

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type foo struct{}

func (f *foo) bar() {
	fmt.Printf("bar called on %T\n", f)
}

func main() {
	f := &foo{}
    (*f).bar() // bar called on *main.foo
}
```

In order to demonstrate the point, I first had to 'dereference' the pointer `(*f)` to get at the 'value' before calling `.bar()` on the struct.

The compiler thus saw `(*f).bar()` and interpreted it as `f.bar()`.

Remember that `f` was already a pointer because when we created `foo` we assigned the memory address location to `f` using `&foo{}`.

So this is why we still see the message `bar called on *main.foo`.

The same principle happens in _reverse_ (i.e. when you have a method whose receiver is a value and not a pointer). 

So if a method defines its receiver as being a value, then the caller of the method _ideally_ should pass a value as the receiver:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type foo struct{}

func (f foo) bar() {
	fmt.Printf("bar called on %T\n", f)
}

func main() {
	f := foo{}

	f.bar() // bar called on main.foo
}
```

> Notice now that instead of `*main.foo` we get `main.foo` as the receiver was a value and not a pointer. 

But as a convenience, the go compiler will automatically handle the passing of a value on behalf of the caller (in the case where they pass a pointer instead):

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type foo struct{}

func (f foo) bar() {
	fmt.Printf("bar called on %T\n", f)
}

func main() {
	f := foo{}

	(&f).bar() // bar called on main.foo
}
```

In order to demonstrate the point, I first had to call `(&f)` to get a 'pointer' before calling `.bar()` on the struct.

The compiler thus saw `(&f).bar()` and interpreted it as `f.bar()`.

Remember that `f` was already a 'value', because when we created `foo` we _didn't_ assign the memory address like we did earlier (`&foo{}`).

So this is why we still see the message `bar called on main.foo`.

In reality the confusion about what's happening is greater, due to the more subtle differences.

For example, in the following code snippet the method expects a pointer receiver but when we create an instance of `foo` we create a value and not a pointer. So when we call `f.bar()` this is interpreted as `(&f).bar()`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type foo struct{}

func (f *foo) bar() {
	fmt.Printf("bar called on %T\n", f)
}

func main() {
	f := foo{}
	f.bar() // bar called on *main.foo
}
```

Or how about that same snippet but in reverse, so the method expects a value receiver but when we create an instance of `foo` we create a pointer. So when we call `f.bar()` this is interpreted as `(*f).bar()`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type foo struct{}

func (f foo) bar() {
	fmt.Printf("bar called on %T\n", f)
}

func main() {
	f := &foo{}
	f.bar() // bar called on main.foo
}
```

Sometimes you're dealing with a type that isn't a struct, like a slice, and so accessing the elements (for example to modify them) requires additional steps, and in some cases extra parentheses (as demonstrated/commented below)...

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type foo []int

func (f *foo) pop() int {
    // notice when we want to grab the length of the slice,
  	// and also when we want to grab a specific element from the slice,
    // we have to first dereference the pointer to get at the underlying value.
  	//
	v := (*f)[len(*f)-1]
  
  	// also notice to reassign a modified slice we again have to
  	// first dereference the pointer to get at the underlying value.
  	//
	*f = (*f)[:len(*f)-1]
	return v
}

func main() {
	f := foo{9, 1, 6, 7, 0}
	
	fmt.Println(f)       // [9 1 6 7 0]
	fmt.Println(f.pop()) // 0
	
	fmt.Println(f)       // [9 1 6 7]
	fmt.Println(f.pop()) // 7
	
	fmt.Println(f)       // [9 1 6]
}
```
