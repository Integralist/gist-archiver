## GitHub Open-Source Pull Request Flow.md

1. Fork open-source project.
2. Create branch and make changes.
3. Push branch to your fork.
4. Visit open-source project and open a pull-request (select your fork's branch).
5. Wait for your PR branch to be merged into the open-source project's `master`.
6. Once merged, add the open-source project as a 'remote' (`git remote add upstream <github.com/user/repo.git>`).
7. `git checkout master`
8. `git fetch upstream` (convention states we use 'upstream' as the name of the remote).
9. `git rebase upstream/master` (alternative to fetch/rebase, is `git pull --rebase upstream master`).
10. `git push origin master`.
11. `git branch -d <your-pr-branch>` (the PR branch is no longer needed).
12. `git push origin --delete <your-pr-branch>`.
