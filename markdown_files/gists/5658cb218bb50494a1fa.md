## Ruby stdlib debugger.md

Program `app.rb`:

```rb
def foo(msg)
  result = bar
  msg
end

def bar
  thing = 123
  thing
end

require "debug" # this is what drops us into the debugger
p foo(:hai)
```

Run the program as normal:

```bash
ruby app.rb
```

We find ourselves not necessarily where we'd expect:

```
Debug.rb
Emacs support available.

/Users/M/.rbenv/versions/2.1.2/lib/ruby/2.1.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:57:        RUBYGEMS_ACTIVATION_MONITOR.enter
(rdb:1) 
```

So first thing to do is to check for any breakpoints:

```
b
=> No breakpoints
```

Let's set a breakpoint for our `foo` method (e.g. whenever it's called we'll stop there):

```
b app.rb:foo
=> Set breakpoint 1 at app.rb:foo
```

Let's check the breakpoint was set:

```
b
=> Breakpoints:
     1 app.rb:foo
```

Let's also set a breakpoint within the `foo` method at line `3` (just after we call the `bar` method and assign its result to `result`):

```
b app.rb:3
=> Set breakpoint 2 at app.rb:3
```

Again, let's check the breakpoint was set:

```
b
=> Breakpoints:
     1 app.rb:foo
     2 app.rb:3
```

Let's remind ourselves where we are before continuing on:

```
w
=> #1 /Users/M/.rbenv/versions/2.1.2/lib/ruby/2.1.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:57:in `require'
```

If we forget any debugging commands we can look at the help:

```

```

Let's just 'continue' to our first breakpoint (which _should_ be the `foo` method being called):

```
c
=> Breakpoint 1, foo at app.rb:foo
   app.rb:1:def foo(msg)
```

To be sure where we are let's use `l` again:

```
l
[-4, 5] in app.rb
=> 1  def foo(msg)
   2    result = bar
   3    msg
   4  end
   5  
```

If at this point I enter the expression `msg` (which is the argument incoming into the `foo` method), then I'll get its value:

```
msg
=> :hai
```

If I press `c` to continue again we'll reach our next breakpoint:

```
c
=> Breakpoint 2, foo at app.rb:3
   app.rb:3:  msg
```

If at this point I enter the expression `result` (which is the variable set within the `foo` method), then I'll get its value that was provided by the `bar` method:

```
result
=> 123
```

I can check for any local variables scoped/available to me at this point of the program:

```
v l
  msg => :hai
  result => 123
```

Before we wrap up, let me restart the program so we can go through the process again but take a slightly different route:

```
r
=> app.rb:57:
```

> Note: the line number `57` doesn't actually make any sense to me to be honest

From here we can 'continue' `c` to get to our first breakpoint (like we did before), but this time instead of skipping over the call to `bar`, we'll use `s` to 'step' into the method and then `n` to go through the next subsequent lines until our program completes):

```
(rdb:1) s
app.rb:2:  result = bar
(rdb:1) l
[-3, 6] in app.rb
   1  def foo(msg)
=> 2    result = bar
   3    msg
   4  end
   5  
   6  def bar
(rdb:1) s
app.rb:7:  thing = 123
(rdb:1) l
[2, 11] in app.rb
   2    result = bar
   3    msg
   4  end
   5  
   6  def bar
=> 7    thing = 123
   8    thing
   9  end
   10  
   11  require "debug"
(rdb:1) v l
  thing => nil
(rdb:1) n
app.rb:8:  thing
(rdb:1) v l
  thing => 123
(rdb:1) n
app.rb:3:  msg
(rdb:1) l
[-2, 7] in app.rb
   1  def foo(msg)
   2    result = bar
=> 3    msg
   4  end
   5  
   6  def bar
   7    thing = 123
(rdb:1) result
123
(rdb:1) v l
  msg => :hai
  result => 123
(rdb:1) n
:hai
```
