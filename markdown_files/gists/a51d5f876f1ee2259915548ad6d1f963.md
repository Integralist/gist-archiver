## Set same cookie on multiple domains.md

```markdown
Reference: http://subinsb.com/set-same-cookie-on-different-domains/

The way Google does this is by creating a server-side script that sets the cookie on all the domains. 

On the domain where the login occurs, create a intermediary page that would load the server-side script that sets a cookie on the other two domains. 

i.e. the user authenticates, and are redirected to `/processing`

In that page you would add an `onload` callback onto the `body` tag. 

The document will only load when the images have completely loaded (i.e. the cookies are set on the other two domains). 

```
<!-- https://www.domain1.com/processing -->

<html>
 <head>
  <script>
   function loadComplete(){
    window.location="https://www.domain1.com/user/settings"; // page to redirect user once they're authenticated
   }
   </script>
 </head>
 <body onload="loadComplete()">
 	Please wait..........
 	<img src="https://www.domain2.com/setcookie.php?user=jwt"/>
 	<img src="https://www.domain3.com/setcookie.php?user=jwt"/>
 </body>
</html>
```
```
