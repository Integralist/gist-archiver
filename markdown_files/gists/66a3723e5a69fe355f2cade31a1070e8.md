## Bash Hash Bang.md

A typical bash script will identify where its interpreter can be found...

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

But this doesn't always work because bash might be installed in a different location.

For example, macOS has an old version of bash (or in more modern releases it has swapped bash completely for zsh) and so a user might manually install an updated version of bash which will go into a different directory...

```bash
#!/usr/local/bin/bash
```

To make your scripts portable across different systems you should reference the `env` executable and pass it the command you want it to locate (i.e. `bash` in this case)...

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

The `env` executable will use whatever bash executable appears first in the running user's `$PATH` variable. 

If you have two version of bash installed (bash1 in `/bin` and bash2 in `/usr/local/bin`) and your PATH was set like so: `/home/foo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin` than bash2 would execute the script.

You can use either `type env` or `command -V env` to locate where the `env` command is installed.
