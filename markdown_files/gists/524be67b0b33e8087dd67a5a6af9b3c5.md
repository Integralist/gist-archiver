## Example System Contract for Caching Behaviours.md

## Caching

- `Cache-Control`: used if provided, otherwise default will be set.
- `Surrogate-Control`: augmented if provided, otherwise default will be set.

### Augmentation

Perimeter will augment the provided `Surrogate-Control` by appending `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` directives if they are not defined.

> See also "[Extensions](#extensions)" section below.

### Defaults

If no `Cache-Control` nor `Surrogate-Control` is provided, Perimeter will use the following default caching/stale directives:

- `Cache-Control`: `no-store`
- `Surrogate-Control`: `max-age=%d, stale-while-revalidate=%d, stale-if-error=%d`

> Note: `%d` is a placeholder for the actual value set in Perimeter's `config.yml`

### Exceptions

There are a few exceptions to the [defaults](#defaults) defined above:

- Static file requests (i.e. proxied to AWS S3) will have a longer `max-age` (it uses the `stale-if-error` value).
- Smoke requests (see `smoke_path` in `config.yml`) disables all caching.

### Extensions

Both `Cache-Control` and `Surrogate-Control` have additional directives related to serving stale content, which are not part of the core HTTP caching standards document. These are `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error`.

Fastly CDN supports both of these extension directives via `Surrogate-Control`, but client compatibility (i.e. web browser support) via `Cache-Control` is less consistent.

Perimeter will only augment `Surrogate-Control`, it will _not_ augment `Cache-Control`.

### Status Codes

The CDN will only cache the following status code responses:

- `200 OK`
- `203 Non-Authoritative Information`
- `300 Multiple Choices`
- `301 Moved Permanently`
- `302 Moved Temporarily`
- `404 Not Found`
- `410 Gone`
