## filter vim quickfix location list results.md

```viml
:packadd cfilter
:Cfilter! /xyz/
```

The `!` is like `grep -v`. 

So  `:Cfilter /xyz/` would filter the results so only those items that have xyz will be kept. If you add the `!` then the results will be everything _except_ xyz. 

> **NOTE**: if you're using something like Ack/Ag then you can use that tools own filtering flags, but if that's not appropriate for whatever reason, then this solution is very useful.

A 'pattern' is basic regex syntax by default (you can get `\v` magic/advanced variation too). 

So by default it means, for example, a regex quantifier like `+` will need to be escaped `\+`.

So if you use the basic syntax you'll find `*` is easier to work with as it doesn't need escaping:

```viml
:Cfilter! '.*/common/.*'
```

Compared to:

```viml
:Cfilter! '.\+/common/.\+'
```

But `\v` helps for more advanced regex syntax:

```viml
:Cfilter! '\v.+/common/.+'
```

> **NOTE**: I've used `'` single quotes as delimeters as I was filtering content that looked like unix file paths.

Refer to `:help cfilter-plugin` for more information.
