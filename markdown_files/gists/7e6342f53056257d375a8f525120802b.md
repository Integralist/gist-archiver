## Google Doc Code Syntax.md

```bash
brew install highlight
```

Now copy some code to your clipboard, followed by running:

```bash
pbpaste | highlight --syntax=go -O rtf | pbcopy
```

> Note: don't 'copy' the above bash code, manually type it, otherwise you'll end up trying to syntax highlight the line of bash! lulz on me for doing exactly that :facepalm:

Now paste your clipboard into your Google doc.
