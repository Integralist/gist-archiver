# Is there a more elegant way in Ruby to filter data from an object and store it in another object. We're searching for a key (which can appear multiple times) and I only want to store the key once, but to also increment that key's value every time the key is found.

## object to object filtering.rb

```ruby
require 'httparty'

data = HTTParty.get('http://some_url/')

browsers = {}

data.each do |item|
  browser = item['browser']['family']

  if browsers[browser]
    browsers[browser] = browsers[browser] + 1
  else
    browsers[browser] = 1
  end

  # yes we *could* use a tertiary conditional but that can be a bit too terse sometimes
  # browsers[browser] = browsers[browser] ? browsers[browser] + 1 : 1 
  # i would argue that's actually harder to read than the expanded if/else
end

puts browsers # {"Chrome Mobile"=>3, "IE Mobile"=>2}

# Update: the following refactor from Kenoir did the trick...
browsers = data.reduce({}) do | obj, item |
  browser = item['browser']['family']
  obj[browser] = (obj[browser].nil?) ? 1 : obj[browser] + 1
  obj
end
```
