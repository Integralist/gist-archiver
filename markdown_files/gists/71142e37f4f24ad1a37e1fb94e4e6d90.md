## Go channel closing.md

```markdown
A common pattern for indicating something is done is to create an unbuffered channel of type `struct{}` and then `close` the channel will unblock anything trying to retrieve a value from the channel.

> Note: the reason for using `struct{}` type is because it's the smallest sized type in Go (no allocations are made).

Below is an example that demonstrates how closing a channel means you can still take values from the channel, but that they'll be the default value of the given type.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	c := make(chan bool)

	go func() {
		c <- true // blocks until someone takes value
	}()

	fmt.Println(<-c) // true pulled from channel
	close(c)
	fmt.Println(<-c) // false which is default value of bool type
}
```
```
