# Storing Passwords (salt + pepper)

## Storing Passwords.md

```markdown
To Store a Password

* Generate a long random salt using a CSPRNG.
* Prepend the salt to the password and hash it with a standard password hashing function like Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2.
* Save both the salt and the hash in the user's database record.

To Validate a Password

* Retrieve the user's salt and hash from the database.
* Prepend the salt to the given password and hash it using the same hash function.
* Compare the hash of the given password with the hash from the database. 
* If they match, the password is correct. Otherwise, the password is incorrect.

Example CSPRNG
