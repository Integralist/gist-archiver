## Pip Python Workflow.md

Some Python projects will have two dependency files:

* `requirements.txt`
* `requirements-to-freeze.txt`

The latter should contain both 'explicit' versions (i.e. versions of dependencies our service is known to support) and 'non-explicit' versions (e.g. no versions defined), where as the former (`requirements.txt`) simply acts as a lockfile.

If we execute `pip freeze` the output will include dependencies that have the explicit versions we requested and the _latest_ version for those dependencies where we defined no explicit version. We can direct that output to a new file called `requirements.txt`.

For example, your `requirements-to-freeze.txt` could look like:

```
# install these explicit versions...
pyjwt>=1.5.3

# install the latest of these...
flake8
pytest
pytest-cov
mock
```
