The simplest way to have `pip install foo` run successfully against your own Pip repository (instead of using the official PyPi) is to:

1. Run a web server that exposes the directory listing (e.g. use [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_autoindex_module.html)).
2. Have the packages you need installed as individual directories on the web server.
3. Setup a `/etc/pip.conf` file locally that is configured to your web server.

For step 2, the directory structure might look something like:

```
.
├── airports
│   └── airports-0.2.tar.gz
└── paho-mqtt
    └── paho-mqtt-1.5.0.tar.gz
```

For step 3, the `/etc/pip.conf` file could look something like:

```ini
[global]
index = http://10.53.1.1/pip/
index-url = http://10.53.1.1/pip/
trusted-host = 10.53.1.1
```

> Note: `10.53.1.1` should be replaced with your own web server IP.

It's worth noting that you don't _need_ a `/etc/pip.conf` file, as those options can be provided on the command line (e.g. `pip install --index-url=<your_webserver_address> <package(s)>`).

Now you should be able to install from your own Python repository:

```bash
$ python3.7 -m venv test_custom_pip
$ source test_custom_pip/bin/activate
$ pip install airports
```

In order to backup the packages your project depends on (e.g. have them installed on your web server in a format that `pip install` will recognize) is to use a tool such as [pip2pi](https://pypi.org/project/pip2pi/).

The `pip2pi` package can be installed via `pip`. It can also use (although optional) a `requirements.txt` file for specifying the packages you want it to download.
