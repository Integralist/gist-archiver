Install package using pip that's associated with the currently running Python interpreter:

```python
python3 -m pip install -e rig
```

Create simple virtual environments for the currently running Python interpreter using [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```python
# create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

# activate the virtual environment
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
```

For a great breakdown of virtual environments and how they work, read: [https://spurin.com/2019/03/12/Python-Virtual-Environments/](https://spurin.com/2019/03/12/Python-Virtual-Environments/). In short, the `activate` command simply prefixes `/path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin` to your `$PATH` environment variable so it'll look there for `pip` and for installing/importing modules.

> Note: subset was built into Python 3.3+ as `venv` module, otherwise use [virtualenv.pypa.io](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for more features.

Use existing Python packages with `-m` to do processing, like JSON formatting:

```python
curl -sL http://j.mp/1IuxaLD | python -m json.tool
```
