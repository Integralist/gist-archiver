## CabinJS.md

Using CabinJS to create my blog, but it only works with GitHub pages (so as I have a user account set-up for my domain repo CabinJS' deployment process doesn't work for me, which means I need to copy the `dist` folder over to my website repo manually).

So rather than write a Rake task (or a Node/Grunt task) and have to spend time looking up the different File system APIs (which I always forget), I've decided to use standard unix commands to achieve the same thing.

Yes I'm sure it *looks* a lot more long winded but it works and took me a lot less time to write...

```sh
alias site="cd ~/Code/CabinJS && 
            touch log.txt && 
            git log --oneline -n 1 | 
            cut -d ' ' -f 2- | 
            xargs -I {} echo {} > log.txt && 
            cd ../Website && 
            cp -r ../CabinJS/dist/* ./ && 
            git add . && 
            git add -A && 
            cat ../CabinJS/log.txt | 
            xargs -I {} git commit -m {} && 
            git push origin master"
```

...to explain what it's doing...

- we move into our CabinJS directory
- we create a log.txt file
- we send to stdout the latest commit message (originally I used `git log --pretty=oneline | sed -n 1p` - where `-n` meant 'no print' and `1p` meant 'print line 1' - before I realised I could avoid `sed` altogether and just use the `-n 1` flag for the git log instead)
- we cut out just the message (ignoring the commit hash)
- we pipe the stdout to xargs where we then write it into the log.txt
- we move into our CabinJS release folder (e.g. where it generates the static site content)
- we copy the content of the release folder (`dist`) into our main Website folder
- we `git add` and `git add -A`
- we send to stdout the content of our log.txt (which is the commit message)
- we then pipe that commit message over to xargs which runs `git commit` using it
- finally we `git push origin master`
