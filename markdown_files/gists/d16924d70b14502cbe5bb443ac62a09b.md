## bash string wildcard glob contains example.sh

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# our CDN was serving stale content for a request that shouldn't be
# so we wrote a quick script to verify the behaviour wasn't happening
# more often than it should.

function get {
  local id=$1
  local url="https://www.example.com/?id=$id"

  local response=$(curl -D - -so /dev/null -H 'X-Debug:1' "$url")
  local state=$(echo "$response" | grep 'Foo-State')

  echo "$state"
}

for i in {1..50}
do
  uid="attempt-$i-$(uuidgen)"

  result1=$(get "$uid")
  result2=$(get "$uid")

  if [[ "$result2" == *"HIT-STALE"* ]]; then
    echo "$uid: got stale :-("
  elif [[ "$result2" == *"HIT-"* ]]; then
    echo "$uid: was fine :-)"
  fi
done
```
