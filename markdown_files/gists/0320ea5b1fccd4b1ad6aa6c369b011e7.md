## Makefile.md

# Make

Make is a build automation tool that uses a file called a Makefile to define how
to build, test, or manage dependencies in a project.

It's commonly used to:

- Compile and link code.
- Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., testing, deploying).
- Track changes in files and only rebuild whatâ€™s necessary.

## Terminology

```Makefile
target: prerequisites
  recipe
```

- target: is expected to be a filename.
- prerequisites: is a list of files the target depends on
- recipe: is the command(s) you run to create the target

The entire block of code (target, prerequisite, recipe) is called a 'rule'.

> \[!NOTE\]
> Not all 'targets' will be a filename because you don't always want to use Make
> to create files. You often want to use Make to just run some code without the
> side-effect of creating a new file. In these cases you annotate your rule with
> `.PHONY: target`.

<!---->

> \[!NOTE\]
> You can have multiple prerequisites, and they can either be a filename or they
> can be the name of another target.

## Automatic Variables

Make's [Automatic Variables] are special variables that represent parts of a
rule, making Makefiles more concise and flexible. They get their values
automatically based on the target, prerequisites, or commands.

You'll see a few different automatic variables used:

- `%`: pattern rule
- `$@`: target name
- `$<`: first prerequisite
- `$^`: list of prerequisites
- `$?`: list of prerequisites that have changed
- `$*`: the stem of a target

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> Any time you need to use a shell variable (i.e. `$foo`) it must be prefixed
> with `$`.\
> This is because `$` already has a special meaning in Make.\
> So, the variable would be referenced like `$$foo` (see also Make's [shell
> function][shell function]).

## Example

Let's look at an example rule:

```Makefile
%.mock.pid: %.mock
  ./%.mock -addr=127.0.0.1:8446 > .$<.log & echo $$! > $@
```

Then it could be invoked (as an example) like so:

```shell
make mustang.mock.pid
```

The `%` wildcard would match the above Makefile _target_ `%.mock.pid`.

Next it would ensure the _prerequisite_ `mustang.mock` existed (i.e. `%.mock`).

Next it would run the `./mustang.mock` binary (i.e. `./%.mock`).

The stdout (`>`) would be written to `.mustang.mock.log` (i.e. `.$<.log`).

Finally, the process ID (`$$!`) is written to `mustang.mock.pid` (i.e. `$@`).

## Performance

Make has built-in rules (e.g., for compiling .c to .o) called implicit rules.\
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Rules.html

The following example disables default implicit rule searches:

```Makefile
# These empty rules tell Make *not* to search for implicit rules for .go, .mk, .json & the Makefile itself.
# Searching for them can be slow. This speeds up dependency checking.
Makefile : ;

# The double-colon `::` fully disables the implicit search.
%.go %.mk %.json :: ;
```

## Functions

There are many [built-in functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Functions.html) you can use.

Here are some useful documentation pages:

- [Text Functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html)
- [File Name Functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/File-Name-Functions.html)
- [Error Handling Functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Make-Control-Functions.html)
