# AWS Instance types

## AWS instance types.md

- General Purpose
  - 	M1, M3 (balanced CPU, Memory, Network resources)
    - Small to mid size databases or data processing tasks

- Compute Optmized
  - C1, CC2 (higher computer power with increased CPUs compared to Memory)
    - High traffic websites, on demand services, web servers, video encoding

- Memory Optimized
  - M2, CR1 (memory intensive applications)
    - High perf databases, distributed cache

- Storage Optimized
  - HI1, HS1 (direct-attached storage, disk I/O & storage capacity requirements)
    - HI1 for NoSQL databases like MongoDB
    - HS1 for data warehouses like Hadoop clusters

- Micro Instances
  - Micro, T1 (small CPU)
    - low throughput applications, low-traffic websites

- GPU Instances
  - CG1 (parallel performance, and high CPU)
    - Very high computational algorithms and graphics rendering
