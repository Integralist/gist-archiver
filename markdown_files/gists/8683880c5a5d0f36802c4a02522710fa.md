## find-python-handlers.sh

# but I kept it in for the sake of me needing to remember the flag and how to use it.
#
# some files use "double" quotes while others use 'single' quotes
# to catch both variations we have to make sure the pattern is wrapped in double quotes
# as this allows us to escape the double quotes used in the pattern itself
# if your pattern was wrapped in single quotes, then the shell will ignore any \ escaping of a single quote within your pattern

## find-regex.sh

# TODO: double check we didn't mean -name instead of -path

# now find all API endpoints defined in those files
# e.g. I want to find things like '/customer/{customer_id}/users:'
$ find -E ~/Code/fastly/api-documentation -iregex '.+/src/.+\.yaml$' -print -exec grep -E '\s/.+:$' {} \;

# now normalise the api by replacing the interpolation syntax {} with ...
# we do this by using gsed's extended regex -E and then starting by finding { and keep going until something that's not an } and then ending match with }

```

## find.sh

```shell
# find any files that contain the given string ("nginx").
# then we use the grep command's -l, --files-with-matches flag to ensure only file names are printed.
# we use the ! operator (same as -not flag) to exclude matches.
# we also have to be careful with files that have spaces in their name, so we use '* *' to try and capture those.
# we also want to avoid dotfiles such as .git
# the output will be paths like './webapp_waf/nginx.conf.j2' so we use the cut command to extract the service name (e.g. webapp_waf)
