## Set Operations.md

## Union

The union of two sets is a set containing all elements that are in A or in B (possibly both). For example, `{1,2}∪{2,3}`=`{1,2,3}`.

## Intersection

The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by `A∩B`, consists of all elements that are both in A and B. For example, `{1,2}∩{2,3}`=`{2}`.

## Difference

The difference (subtraction) is defined as follows. The set `A−B` consists of elements that are in A but not in B. For example if A=`{1,2,3}` and B=`{3,5}`, then `A−B`=`{1,2}`.

## Complement

The complement of a set A, denoted by `Ac`, is the set of all elements that are in the universal set S but are not in A.

## Golang

It is easy to create a set from map:

```go
s := map[int]bool{5: true, 2: true}

_, ok := s[6] // check for existence
s[8] = true   // add element 
delete(s, 2)  // remove element
```

## Union

```go
s_union := map[int]bool{}
for k, _ := range s1{
    s_union[k] = true
}
for k, _ := range s2{
    s_union[k] = true
}
```

## Intersection

```go
s_intersection := map[int]bool{}
for k,_ := range s1 { 
  if s2[k] {
    s_intersection[k] = true
  }
}
```
