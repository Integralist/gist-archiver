## Python Type Hinting MyPy.py

```python
from typing import Union

Number = Union[int, float]

def add(x: Number = 10, y: Number = 5) -> Number:
  print(x, y)
```

## Generating stubs.md

```markdown
You need to generate stubs that are missing, since dependencies such as `boto3` doesn’t provide type hints (as do most packages unfortunately). Mostly we don’t really care about external packages, and type hinting is mostly useful as a documentation tool and can help with autocompletion tools.

So typically you'll run MyPy with: `--ignore-missing-imports`.

> Note: alternatively specify which modules you want to ignore [like this](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3905#issuecomment-421065323).

Consider the following code:

```py
import boto3

from botocore.client import BaseClient

client = boto3.client('cognito-idp')

def foo(client: BaseClient):
    print('hey')

foo('ccccc')
```

MyPy will not see any problems here because we'll either have generated a stub for boto3 or we would be skipping the import altogether.

To generate the missing stub for boto3:

1. generate stubs: `stubgen --recursive botocore`
2. `MYPYPATH='./out' mypy your_file.py`

> `./out` is the default directory `stubgen` where `stubgen` puts the stubs

Then executing MyPy will pick up the error:

```
test.py:12: error: Argument 1 to "foo" has incompatible type "str"; expected "BaseClient"
```
```
