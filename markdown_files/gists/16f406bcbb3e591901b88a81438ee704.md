## Python Tox Explanation.md

Tox is a tool that creates virtual environments, and installs the configured dependencies for those environments, for the purpose of testing a Python package (i.e. something that will be shared via PyPi, and so it only works with code that defines a `setup.py`).

The file that you use to configure tox can be one of the following...

> Note: these are all [ini file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) formats.

- `tox.ini`
- `pyproject.toml` (see [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/))
- `setup.cfg` (see [official guide to distributing packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/))

All configuration options for tox can be found here:
[tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html)

## Example tox.ini

> Note: the name after `testenv:` is the _name_ of the virtual environment that will be created (e.g. `testenv:foo` will create a "foo" virtual environment).

```ini
[tox]
envlist = 
    py37, lint
toxworkdir = 
    {env:TOX_WORK_DIR}

[testenv]
setenv =
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE = 1
whitelist_externals =
    /bin/bash
deps = 
    -rrequirements-dev.txt
commands =
    py.test --cov={envsitepackagesdir}/bf_tornado -m "not integration"

[testenv:dev]
usedevelop=True
recreate = False
commands =
    # to run arbitrary commands: tox -e dev -- bash
    {posargs:py.test --cov=bf_tornado}

[testenv:lint]
deps = flake8==3.7.9
commands =
    flake8 bf_tornado
```

## Configuring _other_ packages

A `tox.ini` file can be used to configure different types of packages, which is confusing at first because the tox home page suggests that tox is used to test _your own_ packages you plan on distributing to PyPi.

What is meant by that is the `tox` command itself is used to handle testing your packages, while the `tox.ini` _configuration file_ is just one such file that can be used to contain configuration information.

This is why other packages, such as [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) allow you to [configure it](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html) using the `tox.ini` file (or alternatively either `setup.cfg` or `.flake8` files can be used). 

The key to understanding why this works is as so: each of these files conforms to the [ini file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) format. So you're free to use whatever file 'name' you feel best suits your project, while the format of the file will stay consistent to what is expected of an `.ini` file.

Below is an example that shows various Python packages being configured within a `tox.ini` file.

In case it's unclear, the configuration inside of the `tox.ini` file is used instead of having to pass those configuration values via the command line. So in the case of a tool such as `flake8`, instead of using `flake8 --max-line-length=120` you could just call `flake8` and the flag value is extracted from the configuration file.

```ini
[flake8]
max_line_length = 120
ignore = E261,E265,E402  # http://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes

[coverage:run]
branch = True

[coverage:report]
show_missing = True
exclude_lines =
    raise NotImplementedError
    return NotImplemented
    def __repr__
omit = bf_tornado/testing.py

[pytest]
addopts = 
    --strict -p no:cacheprovider --showlocals
markers =
    integration: mark a test as an integration test that makes http calls.
```
