## Check if file was modified more than N time ago

The following commands will indicate if the specified file (`/tmp/cache-lazy-op`) was modified more than 60 minutes ago:

```shell
find "/tmp/cache-lazy-op" -mmin +60
fd cache-lazy-op /tmp --type f --changed-before 60m
```

The `find` command is more readily available and simpler to remember, but some people prefer more modern tools like `fd`.

> [!NOTE]
> This isn't checking how old the file is, but _specifically_ whether it was last modified over an hour ago.
