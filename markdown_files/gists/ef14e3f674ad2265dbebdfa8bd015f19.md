## black pyproject.toml

```toml
# to install black via poetry use:
#
# poetry add --dev --allow-prereleases black
#
# which generates:
#
# black = {version = "^18.3-alpha.0",allows-prereleases = true}
#
# but notice the value below is slightly different, which iirc is because we used a different version of Python which needed to be defined?
#
# but using the --allow-prereleases flag on the command line worked for me on a fresh project so :shrugs:
