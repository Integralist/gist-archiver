## Simple Vim TODO list.bash

```shell
alias did="vim +'normal Go' +'r!date' ~/did.txt"

# executing `did` in a shell will open the file `~/did.txt` in vim,
# while prefixing the current line with a date/time.
#
# Example...

# - i manually typed this line
# - and this one
# - i use it to demonstrate multiple things I did
#
