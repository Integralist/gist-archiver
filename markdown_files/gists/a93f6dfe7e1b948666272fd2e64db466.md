## Python ignore pylint flake8 errors.md

Disable all linting across the entire file:

```py
# pylint: disable-all (older)
# pylint: skip-file   (newer)
# flake8: noqa
```

Disable specific linting errors across the entire file:

```py
# pylint: disable=123
```

> Note: flake8 can't do this, unless you use something like `tox.ini`  
> So by adding `ignore = F403,E501` in a `[flake8]` section of `setup.cfg` or `tox.ini`
> I've also seen this to be configurable with a .flake8 file instead of a tox.ini

Disable specific linting errors for specific lines:

```py
some_code  # noqa: E731,E123
some_code  # noqa pylint: disable=unused-import
```
