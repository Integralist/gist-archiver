# Currying vs Partial Application

## Currying vs Partial Application.md

```markdown
When we use Partial Application we always execute our function twice (regardless of the number of arguments). 

When we use Currying we execute our function once for each argument.

## Examples of Partial Application

```js
// `partial` is a made up function
fn  = function (a, b, c) { return a + b + c }
foo = partial(fn, 'x', 'y')
foo('z') // => 'xyz'
```

In the next example we can see that it's possible to change the arguments we partially apply:

```js
// `partial` is a made up function
fn  = function (a, b, c) { return a + b + c }
foo = partial(fn, 'x')
foo('y', 'z') // => 'xyz'
```

> Note how with Partial Application we make a function call twice (once when partially applying the arguments; and again when we fulfil the rest of the arguments). But remember: we can choose how many arguments we partially apply on the first call.

## Examples of Currying

```js
// `curry` is a made up function
fn  = function (a, b, c) { return a + b + c }
foo = curry(fn)
foo('x')('y')('z') // => 'xyz'
```

```js
// `curry` is a made up function
fn  = function (a, b, c) { return a + b + c }
foo = curry(fn)
bar = foo('x')
bar('y')('z') // => 'xyz'
```

> Note that a function that has been curried wont return the value of the function until each argument has been provided (i.e. satisfied). The arguments are manually partially applied one by one.
