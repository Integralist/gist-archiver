## rust environment.md

The default toolchain in rust is "stable".

A user can execute `rustup override set <toolchain>` to change the default toolchain (e.g. to "nightly" or a specific toolchain version installed using `rustup toolchain install <toolchain>`), and this will be reflected when running either `rustup show active-toolchain` or `rustc --version` (i.e. either of those latter commands will show the version set to be the same as the specified override). The `rustup override set` command also takes priority over anything set within a `rust-toolchain` file:

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "stable" # << this would be overridden by `rustup override set <toolchain>`
targets = [ "wasm32-wasi" ]
```

> **NOTE**: The behaviour triggered by `rustup default <toolchain>` is also reflected in the output of `rustup show active-toolchain` and `rustc --version`, but (unlike `rustup override set`) the behaviour concedes to whatever is defined inside the `rust-toolchain` file.

Additionally the `cargo build` command can accept a `+<toolchain>` indicator (e.g. `cargo +1.54.0 build`) and that can override any of the prior behaviours I've covered.

Here are some useful commands for understanding the rust environment:

- `rustup show` (combines a bunch of the below data into a 'summary' view)
- `rustup default`
- `rustup show active-toolchain`
- `rustup override list`
- `rustup toolchain list`
- `rustup target list --installed --toolchain <toolchain>`
- `rustup target add <target> --toolchain <toolchain>`
- `rustup update <toolchain>` (e.g. update what 'stable' refers to †)
- `rustc --print sysroot`
- `ls -la $(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib` (check for installed targets like `wasm32-wasi`)

> † Which is different to any specific toolchain that has been manually installed (using `rustup toolchain install <toolchain>`) and then set to be the default using `rustup default <toolchain>`.
