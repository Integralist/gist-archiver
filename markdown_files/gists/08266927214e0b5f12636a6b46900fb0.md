## Calculate Percentages.md

A class has 28 children. 

Seven of them play the piano - what percentage of the class is this?

```
7 / 28 x 100 = 25%
```

There are 378 README files.

Only 20 of them are valid - what percentage of the READMEs is this?

```
20 / 378 x 100 = 5%
```

Given Data:

Normal Logs (N): 827  
Error Logs (E): 212  
Total Logs (T): N + E = 827 + 212 = 1039

Percentage of Error Logs:
Calculation: `(E / T) * 100` = `(212 / 1039) * 100 ≈ 20.4%`

Percentage of Normal Logs:
Calculation: `(N / T) * 100` = `(827 / 1039) * 100 ≈ 79.6%`

To calculate a specific percentage you first have to calculate `1%`.  
Then you can multiple that result by the percentage you're after. 

For example, imagine we have 80 balls, and we want to see what 50% of that number is...

```
total = 80
1% = total/100
50% = (total/100)*50 = 40
```

Some alternative ways to do it...

```
£350,000 × 1% ×.01

3,500

£350,000 × 0.9% ×.01

3,150
```
