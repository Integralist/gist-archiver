## Markdown syntax for links in bottom of document.md

blah blah [something][] here.

...other content...

yada yada [beepboop][foobar] goes here. 

> Notice parentheses aren't used like a normal link `[text](link)` but two square brackets `[text][ref]`.

The below link references won't be visible in the generated markdown so you'll have to click on 'edit' (or 'view raw') to see it.

[something]: ../relative/link
[foobar]: https://absolute.link.com
