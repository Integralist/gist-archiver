# Terminal Resize Images with ImageMagick

## Terminal Resize Images with ImageMagick.md

## Installation

```bash
brew install imagemagick
```

## Commands

The ImageMagick commands that modify images are `mogrify` and `convert`.

By default, the `mogrify` command overwrites the existing image with the modified image unless you specify an output folder into which modified image will be saved.

The `convert` command saves a new modified image and leaves the original unchanged so it is safer to use.

## Add Border

```bash
mogrify -path Newimage/ -border 1x1 -bordercolor "#000000" image.png
```

or

```bash
convert -border 1x1 -bordercolor "#000000" image.png Newimage/new-image.png
```

## Resize

To reduce an imageâ€™s width to 790 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio, and to avoid increasing the size of the image if it is already smaller than 790 pixels wide, use either of the commands:

```bash
mogrify -path Newimage/ -resize "790>" image.png
```

or

```bash
convert -resize "790>" image.png Newimage/image.png
```

## Change File Type

```bash
convert image.png Newimage/image.jpg
```

## Quality

The default JPEG qualilty is 92% but you may set it to any value from 0% to 100%.

For example, to convert all the PNG images in a directory to JPEG with 70% quality, enter the command:

```bash
convert -quality 70 image.png Newimage/image.jpg
```

## Combining Transformations

```bash
convert -resize "790>" -border 1x1 -bordercolor "#000000" -quality 70 image.png converted.jpg
```

You can also use wildcards to batch process (but not change format or rename):

```bash
mogrify -path Newimage/ -resize "790>" -border 1x1 -bordercolor "#000000" *.*
```

If you want to change the format or rename a file in a batch, then you need the `convert` command, but that doesn't handle wildcards so you need to do something like:

```bash
mkdir Newimage
for i in *.png; do convert "$i" "Newimage/${i%.*}.jpg"; done
```

To then combine those transformations:

```bash
for i in *.png; do convert -resize "790>" -border 1x1 -bordercolor "#000000" -quality 70 "$i" "Newimage/${i%.*}.jpg"; done
```
