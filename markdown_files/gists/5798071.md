# Example of how Sass mixins when used excessively and without thought can actually be more of a code smell than a helper.

## Maintainability.md


We had multiple mixins for prefixing properties such as:

- `border-box`
- `border-radius`
- `box-shadow`
- ...on and on...

When realistically we just needed...

```sass
@mixin vendor ($property, $value) {
    -webkit-#{$property}: $value;
       -moz-#{$property}: $value;
        -ms-#{$property}: $value;
         -o-#{$property}: $value;
            #{$property}: $value;
}
```

...which you would use as for example: `@include vendor(box-sizing, border-box);`

Yes this adds prefixes that might not be needed (e.g. border-radius is reasonably well supported in older versions of Firefox and WebKit) but this repeatable content will get chewed up when it comes to GZIP'ing.
