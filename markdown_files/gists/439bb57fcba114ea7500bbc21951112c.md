## What is a SKU.md

SKU stands for stock-keeping unit. 

It is mostly the unit used by Salesforce, and all other business systems to 'sell' and invoice for products/features we sell

It can take up to a quarter or more to get a SKU.

You can't sell something for $$ without a SKU.

Monetization engineering often won't get started on any work without a SKU/product description in Salesforce.
