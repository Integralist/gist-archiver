## Context

The BBC News Frameworks team is responsible for designing and developing web services and tooling utilised by the wider BBC engineering teams. We're looking for a Senior Ruby Programmer to help lead the technical design and development of product requirements.

If you're passionate about solid object-oriented code design, investigating emerging web technologies and building highly scalable micro services for the future of the BBC News platform, then we'd love to hear from you.

If you don’t currently match the job spec completely then don’t let this dissuade you from applying. We’re looking for intelligent people who are quick to learn and adapt. The BBC is the perfect place to do just that: we invest heavily in helping our engineers to grow in all aspects of their career.

## Purpose of the role

The primary focus at this stage is on the evolution of our internal "page composition as a service" (CAAS) platform, codename: Mozart. Mozart is a collection of decoupled micro services designed to parse routing information and to render components required for the page being requested using dynamic configuration.

We're almost at our initial v1 milestone and are considering requirements for v2, which you'll be heavily invoiced with its design and conception as well as joining the discussion amongst senior technical architects in order to ensure a robust and scalable system. 

You'll be working with the Ruby programming language, as well as a little Go, and utilising technologies such as Docker to help keep the local development workflow fluid.
