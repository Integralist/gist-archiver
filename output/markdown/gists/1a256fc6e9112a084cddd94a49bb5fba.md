# Python if/else list comprehension (generator expression)

## Python if else list comprehension (generator expression).py

```python
[i if i is True else 'nope' for i in [True, False, True]]

# [True, 'nope', True]

# Notice this is a conditional expression and different from list comprehension
# Which typically is `for ... if ...`
# Now it's reversed and no expression for truthy condition `if x <condition> else <expression>`
```
