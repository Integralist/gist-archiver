# [Stage hunks for untracked files in git] #git #patch #staged #untracked

## git stage hunks.md

```markdown
If you've created a bunch of new files in git, use `git add --intent-to-add` (or `git add -N`) to move the files from untracked to unstaged. 

This way you can incrementally stage hunks similar to how you can stage hunks from previously committed files.
