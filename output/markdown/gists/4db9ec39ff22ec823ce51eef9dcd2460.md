## gnu sed alternation

```text
# I wanted to strip lines ending with . followed by five possible values
# I couldn't do this with macOS BSD sed so used gnu sed
# But also needed to do some weird unexpected things like...
#
# 1. escape the capture group parentheses
# 2. escape the alternator pipe character

gsed 's/\.\(avg\|count\|median\|95percentile\|max\)$//'
```
