## Go 1.16

As of Go version `1.16` the `go` command changed behaviour for `get` and `install`:

- `install`: the recommended way to install packages (ignoring 
- `get`: adds dependencies to your project's go modules file (i.e. `go.mod`).

The `go install` command now accepts a version suffix:

```
go install example.com/cmd@v1.0.0
```

## Pre Go 1.16

Before Go version `1.16` we needed to resort to other ways of getting a resource.

Have the following package `tools/tools.go`:

```go
// +build tools

package tools

import (
	// document generation
	_ "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/cmd/tfplugindocs"
)
```

> **Note**: the use of a build tag means `go build` won't compile the code into your binary.

Have the following `Makefile`:

```Makefile
BIN=$(CURDIR)/bin
$(BIN)/%:
	@echo "Installing tools from tools/tools.go"
	@cat tools/tools.go | grep _ | awk -F '"' '{print $$2}' | GOBIN=$(BIN) xargs -tI {} go install {}

# Inject ./bin into PATH to allow scripts/generate-docs.go to access local tfplugindocs binary
generate-docs: $(BIN)/tfplugindocs
	PATH=$(PATH):$(BIN) go run scripts/generate-docs.go

validate-docs: $(BIN)/tfplugindocs
	$(BIN)/tfplugindocs validate
```

> **Note**: pay special attention to the fact that `$` is a reserved symbol in a Makefile so we have to escape it: `$$`.

Now you'll find you have the dependency installed:

```bash
ls -la $GOPATH/bin

-rwxr-xr-x   1 integralist  staff  22965276  2 Feb 13:52 tfplugindocs*
```
```
