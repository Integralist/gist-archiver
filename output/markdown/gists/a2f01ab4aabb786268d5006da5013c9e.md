## Python equivalent to Ruby's Pry.md

```markdown
## Basic

```py
import code; code.interact(local=locals())
```

## Advanced

IPython with `embed()`

Install it with:

```bash
pip install ipython
```

Use it like so:

```py
from IPython import embed

# Misc code

embed() # this will drop us into IPython

# Misc code
```

Although you can use it directly as well:

```py
import IPython

x = "foo"
print(x)

IPython.embed()

x = "bar"
print(x)
```
```
