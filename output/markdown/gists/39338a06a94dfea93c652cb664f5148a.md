# [Go TOML Examples with custom Marshaller] #go #golang #toml

## 1. README.md

```markdown
The following files demonstrate how the CLI will handle the input toml.

Here are the files:

- [`example.toml`](#file-example-toml): it represents similar content to what `fastly.toml` holds and we expect the CLI to manage.
- [`main.go`](#file-main-go): a reduced test case go program that attempts to decode/encode the provided toml to see how it handles things by default.
- [`output`](#file-output): shows the output of the go program.

## Summary

The TOML library will continue to produce more verbose output, and will overwrite the users toml with the verbose variation (only for `fastly.toml`, as that's the only file that CLI manages).

## Custom Marshaller

I've written a custom marshaller but there are some issues to keep in mind.

First, here's the implementation of the custom marshal:

```go
func (m Manifest) MarshalTOML() ([]byte, error) {
	var b bytes.Buffer

	b.WriteString("managed = " + m.Managed + "\n\n")
	b.WriteString("[testing.backends]\n")

	for k, v := range m.Testing.Backends {
		line := fmt.Sprintf("%s = { url = \"%s\" }\n", k, v.URL)
		b.WriteString(line)
	}

	return b.Bytes(), nil
}
```

Here are the issues:

1. The order of the backends are non-deterministic so they won't necessarily match what the user entered originally.
2. This is a very simple implementation and so we don't analyse the original syntax. This means if the user writes their toml over multiple lines, then the CLI will overwrite that with the more concise version defined in `MarshalTOML`.
3. The user is going to mostly copy/paste toml between `fastly.toml` and their environment files. Meaning: there will be a difference between the `fastly.toml` (which the CLI will overwrite the toml with more verbose toml syntax) and the environment files that the CLI doesn't manage.
```

## example.toml

```toml
managed = "by CLI"

[testing.backends]
foo = { url = "https://foo.com/"}
"bar.baz" = { url = "https://barbaz.com/"}
qux = { url = "https://qux.com/"}
```

## main.go

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/pelletier/go-toml"
)

func main() {
	fpath := "example.toml"

    	// NOTE: trying both Decode/Encode and Unmarshal/Marshal to see if there were any differences (there aren't).

	md := decode(fpath)
	toml.NewEncoder(os.Stdout).Encode(md)

	mu := unmarshal(fpath)
	b, _ := toml.Marshal(mu)
	fmt.Println(string(b))
}

func decode(fpath string) Manifest {
	fmt.Println("\nDECODE")

	var m Manifest

	f, err := os.OpenFile(fpath, os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE, 0755)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("decode: %w", err)
	}

	toml.NewDecoder(f).Decode(&m)

	fmt.Printf("\n%+v\n\n", m)

	return m
}

func unmarshal(fpath string) Manifest {
	fmt.Println("\nUNMARSHAL")

	var m Manifest

	f, err := os.OpenFile(fpath, os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE, 0755)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("unmarshal: %w", err)
	}

	b, err := io.ReadAll(f)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	toml.Unmarshal(b, &m)

	fmt.Printf("\n%+v\n\n", m)

	return m
}

type Manifest struct {
	Managed string  `toml:"managed"`
	Testing Testing `toml:"testing"`
}

type Testing struct {
	Backends map[string]Backend `toml:"backends"`
}

type Backend struct {
	URL string `toml:"url"`
}
```

## output

```text
