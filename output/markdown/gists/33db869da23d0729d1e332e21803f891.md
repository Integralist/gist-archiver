Running benchmarks requires the `-bench` flag to be given a valid regex pattern:

```go
go test -v -bench=.
```

> Note: this will still run all the tests (as you're using the `go test` subcommand).

Run benchmarks but disable tests from being run:

```go
go test -v -bench=. -run=XXX
```

> Note: we've disabled the tests by passing a valid regex pattern to the `-run` flag, which will not match any known tests.
```
