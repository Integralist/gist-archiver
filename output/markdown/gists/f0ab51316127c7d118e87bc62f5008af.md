## 2. Confusing io.Pipe example.go

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"sync"
)

func readFrom(pr *io.PipeReader, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	b, _ := io.ReadAll(pr)
	fmt.Println(string(b), ".")
}

func main() {
	wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
	wg.Add(2)

	pr, pw := io.Pipe()

	go readFrom(pr, &wg) // this will consume all three writes in one single read.
  	go readFrom(pr, &wg) // this secondary read needs pw.Close() to unblock it!
  						 // specifically, the pipe reader will keep going util the
  						 // writer has signified an EOF, which wont happen without
						 // the call to Close(). 
  						 //
  						 // this problem wouldn't exist if we had used a different
  						 // read method, but as we used ioutil.ReadAll it is designed
  						 // around the expectation of an EOF.

	pw.Write([]byte("foo"))
	pw.Write([]byte("-"))
	pw.Write([]byte("bar"))

  	pw.Close() // do before Wait() otherwise deadlock (see comment above)

	wg.Wait()
}
```

Two of my favour features in Go are:

1. `io.TeeReader(r, w)`
2. `pr, pw := io.Pipe()`

TeeReader will write to `w` every time there is a read from `r`.

Pipe will read from `pr` every time there is a write to `pw`.

To consume from a single reader twice:

```go
io.TeeReader(r, pw)
```

For example, when we pass the `io.TeeReader` to a function expecting an `io.Reader`, the function will read the data, and while it's reading the data it will simultaneously write the read data to `pw`, and when that happens the `pr` will read the data from `pw`.

Sometimes you need an `io.ReadCloser` but `io.TeeReader` only returns an `io.Reader`, so to fix that you need a custom type and constructor:

```go
// By embedding the two interfaces into the struct,
// it means our struct instance must fulfill the interfaces.
type readCloser struct {
	io.Reader
	io.Closer
}

// We create a new instance of readCloser.
// The Reader field is set to the io.TeeReader.
// While the Closer field is set to the original io.ReadCloser.
func newTeeReadCloser(rc io.ReadCloser, w io.Writer) io.ReadCloser {
	return &readCloser{
		Reader: io.TeeReader(rc, w),
		Closer: rc,
	}
}
```
```

## 1. io.Pipe and io.TeeReader combined.go

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"strings"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
	wg.Add(1)

	r := strings.NewReader("Test")
	pr, pw := io.Pipe()
	tee := io.TeeReader(r, pw)

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()

		fmt.Println("about to block thread waiting for a write to io.Pipe's reader")
		content, _ := io.ReadAll(pr)
		fmt.Println("1: ", content)
	}()

	fmt.Println("about to block main thread until write to io.TeeReader's configured writer is complete")
	content, _ := io.ReadAll(tee) // this will force a write to io.TeeReader's writer
	fmt.Println("2: ", content)

	pw.Close() // close the io.Pipe first before waiting for thread to complete (otherwise get a deadlock)

	wg.Wait()
}
```
