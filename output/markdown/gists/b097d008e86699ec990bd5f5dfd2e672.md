# [Copying Files and Directories] #bash #cp #copy #files #directories

## 1. README.md

```markdown
A trailing slash == copy all files\
No trailing slash == copy the directory
```

## Caution with Bash when copying Files and Directories.bash

```shell
# copy src directory into the destination directory
# i.e. you'll end up with compute/src/...
cp -r src ~/Code/rust/compute/

# copy the 'files' from the src directory into the destination directory
# i.e. you'll end up with compute/...
#
# NOTICE the subtle difference! a trailing slash on src/ will 
# copy the files within that directory rather than the directory as a whole.
cp -r src/ ~/Code/rust/compute/
```
