# Potential job description for a PHP developer

## vacancy.md

```markdown
We are looking for a full-time web developer to join our expanding digital media team.

The candidate needs to be enthusiastic, proactive and passionate about programming. And, as well as having a killer set of skills already, you will need to want to learn new talents, understand the latest web development technologies and get to grips with the latest programming languages.

Although much of the work will be ‘backroom’, there will also be times when you will need to liaise directly with clients – in person, over the phone and by email – to help them with issues directly, so outstanding communication skills are also a must.

Finally, as part of our growing team, you will need to work well with other people, as well as take responsibility for your own work within specific projects.

-------------------------------------------------------

We need someone who is highly skilled in the following areas:

Back-end:

* MVC/Object-Oriented PHP (v.5+)
* Capable of developing complex data driven systems (without the aid of a framework! We don't shy away from using frameworks, but we understand the benefits of when and where to use them, and you should too!)
* Capable of developing secure (SSL) e-commerce systems that plug into different payment systems (such as Barclays, WorldPay etc)
* Adaptive thinker/problem solver (if you've not encountered a particular request before then you need to be able to research and find a solution quickly)
* Unit-Test your code (we know this is a pain, but the benefits far outweigh the negatives)
* Version Control (we use the Git Version Control system)

Front-end:

* Solid JavaScript knowledge is essential. As modern web applications are now starting to blur the boundaries of what can be achieved and making applications feel more 'desktop like'.
    
    > e.g. Ajax, DOM manipulation, cross browser implementations etc, ideally without a framework!
    
    > Not using a framework would be ideal as it'll demonstrate you understand the actual language itself.
    
    > But we have been known to use jQuery on some projects too.
    
    > You should be able to determine when it's best to use a framework and when not to, and we expect as part of your skills to know the pitfalls/best practices of the library.

Database:

* MySQL (v.5+)

-------------------------------------------------------

In addition, the following technical skills are not required but would be to the successful candidate’s advantage:: 

* Knowledge of Design Patterns and when best to use them.
* Understanding of (or better yet direct experience) how to architect a system to be scalable for high load usage
* Understanding of (or skills to implement existing/develop own) push notification system
* Server performance considerations (e.g. in case we need you to investigate performance issues potentially related to your code before hassling server engineers)
* Regular Expressions
* HTML5 (this is a bit of a 'loaded' term, which means more than what HTML5 strictly covers - such as SVG, CSS 3, CORS, Geolocation etc - but your passion for technology will mean you are aware of these intricacies)
* iOS app development (native Android app development would be interesting too)

-------------------------------------------------------

Responsibilities

* Report any issues (technical or otherwise) to your line manager
* All projects should have a technical specification of functionality written up for client approval before development begins - which you will handle.
* Pro actively discuss new ideas and techniques with your colleagues (being passionate about technology you'll be excited to share what you've learnt)
* Be understanding. Sometimes a client can make a poor judgement/decision. We will always advise our clients of our recommended solution, but if the client chooses to ignore our advice then so be it - accept it and move on.

-------------------------------------------------------

Salary is negotiable depending on what skills you have and the skills you're missing. But don't worry if you feel like you don't "tick all the boxes", you may have enough for us to find a place for you in our team!
