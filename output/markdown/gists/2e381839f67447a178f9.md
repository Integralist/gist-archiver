# git merge --squash brings in your changes but doesn't create a commit. Instead it will stage your changes so you can create a fresh commit for it (avoiding ugly merge commits showing in GitHub when using a standard git merge)

## git-merge-squash.sh

```shell
git merge --squash <branch|commit> # only works with single commits

# When specifying a commit hash, this is still different from something like
# `git cherry-pick` because that would create a commit where as --squash simply
# copies the changes into your staging area
```
