# Compute readthrough cache validator

This directory contains a Compute application that proxies incoming requests
onto [https://http-me.glitch.me/](https://http-me.glitch.me/).

There is a `run.sh` script which will attempt to validate the
responses from the Compute service to see what cache semantics are respected.

> [!TIP]
> Read the official Fastly documentation: [readthrough cache](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/guides/concepts/edge-state/cache/#readthrough-cache)

The `run.sh` script does the following:

- Checks if `real` is passed as an input argument.
  - If yes, it attempts to deploy the Compute application to Fastly.
  - Otherwise, it attempts to run the Compute application locally.
- It makes multiple requests to the Compute application.
- It validates that the responses are as expected.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> It doesn't make sense (currently) to try and run this script without `real` as the input argument, because it causes the script to run the Compute application locally using `fastly compute serve`, which itself uses https://github.com/fastly/viceroy/ and Viceroy (at the moment) has no support for cache semantics.

## POPs and Retries

A request that you might expect to return a cache HIT, could return a MISS. This
is because the request can end up at a different POP to where a previous request
for the resource ended up.

For example, in the UK there are multiple POPs. Nearest to me are the `LHR` and
`LCY` POPs. This means I can make a request that ends up at the `LHR` POP, and
if I make a second request and it also ends up at the same POP, then I'll get a
cache HIT, otherwise if the request ends up at the `LCY` POP I'll get a cache
MISS.

To try and account for this the `run.sh` script will re-attempt the request a
number of times before marking it as unsuccessful. Ultimately, we want to be
sure a request is either cached or not cached, so depending on what the
expectation is, we give the script the best chance possible to validate the
expectation accurately.

## Summary of results

Refer to the `run.sh` script for the details.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Fastly VCL documentation](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/reference/vcl/variables/backend-response/beresp-cacheable/) suggests a 302 is cacheable, but it's not in Compute.

# NOTE: "Fastly-Debug:1" forces the display of the `Surrogate-Control` header.
# We don't set Fastly-Debug because we want to validate Surrogate-Control is omitted from the response.
#
# IMPORTANT: Compute doesn't strip Surrogate-Control for POST requests.
# This is to support VCL service chaining where VCL needs to cache the response.
# Meaning the VCL service requires the Surrogate-Control still.
# The Compute team will investigate if it's possible to fix this so that a
# Compute service will strip the header if not fronted by another Fastly
# service. Now, although POST requests don't strip Surrogate-Control and GET
# requests do, the Viceroy testing tool NEVER strips Surrogate-Control and this
# appears to be related to the fact that it has no cache semantics support.
