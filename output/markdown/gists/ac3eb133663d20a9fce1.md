# Ruby Array Guarding

## Ruby Array Guarding.md

```markdown
Below is an example of trying to protect against a request for data failing to return the expected data structure (in this case an Array)...

```ruby
expect_an_array_back = SomeClass.make_a_request_for_data

if expect_an_array_back.any?
  expect_an_array_back.each do |user|
    # ...
  end
end
```

Instead we should guard against failing in a cleaner way. 

If the collection is empty then we can just loop over the Array without a guard, like so...

```ruby
SomeClass.make_a_request_for_data.each do |user|
  # ...
end
```

Or in situations where we're not sure if we'll get an empty Array or `nil` then we can wrap the returned value in an Array and if it is `nil` then `Array(expect_an_array_back)` will be converted into an empty collection (which will be safe to enumerate), like so...

```ruby
expect_an_array_back = SomeClass.make_a_request_for_data

Array(expect_an_array_back).each do |user|
  # ...
end
```
```
