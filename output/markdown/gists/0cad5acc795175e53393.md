| Macro Name       | Name                    | Location               | Purpose |
|:-----------------|:------------------------|:-----------------------|:------- |
| `%_specdir`      | Specification directory | `~/rpmbuild/SPECS`     | RPM specifications (`.spec`) files |
| `%_sourcedir`    | Source directory        | `~/rpmbuild/SOURCES`   | Pristine source package (e.g. tarballs) and patches |
| `%_builddir`     | Build directory         | `~/rpmbuild/BUILD`     | Source files are unpacked and compiled in a subdirectory underneath this. |
| `%_buildrootdir` | Build root directory    | `~/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT` | Files are installed under here during the `%install` stage. |
| `%_rpmdir`       | Binary RPM directory    | `~/rpmbuild/RPMS`      | Binary RPMs are created and stored under here. |
| `%_srcrpmdir`    | Source RPM directory    | `~/rpmbuild/SRPMS`     | Source RPMs are created and stored here. |

## Setup

```bash
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{RPMS,SRPMS,BUILD,SOURCES,SPECS,tmp}

cat <<EOF >~/.rpmmacros
%_topdir   %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild
%_tmppath  %{_topdir}/tmp
EOF

cd ~/rpmbuild
```

## Tarball your project

```bash
mkdir foo-1.0
mkdir -p foo-1.0/usr/bin
mkdir -p foo-1.0/etc/foo
install -m 755 foo foo-1.0/usr/bin
install -m 644 foo.conf foo-1.0/etc/foo/

tar -zcvf foo-1.0.tar.gz foo-1.0/
```

## Copy to SOURCES

```bash
cp foo-1.0.tar.gz SOURCES/

cat <<EOF > SPECS/foo.spec
# Don't try fancy stuff like debuginfo, which is useless on binary-only
# packages. Don't strip binary too
# Be sure buildpolicy set to do nothing
%define        __spec_install_post %{nil}
%define          debug_package %{nil}
%define        __os_install_post %{_dbpath}/brp-compress

## Build

```bash
rpmbuild -ba SPECS/foo.spec
```

## Directory Structure

Simple example of what the directory structure looks like and means in practice...

```
.
├── BUILD
├── RPMS
├── SOURCES
│   ├── http://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-2.1.2.tar.gz
├── SPECS
│   ├── ruby.spec
├── SRPMS
```

The BUILD folder is where all files go which are created during a build of the package when you create the rpm.  

If the package builds correctly then any rpm(s) created will go into the RPMS and SRPMS folders.  

The SRPMS directory only contains source rpms.  

Spec files are basically instructions on how the rpm is built and they go in the SPECS folder.  

The source tar file should go into the SOURCES directory along with any patches.

## Miscellaneous Information

- Spec file naming convention: `<package_name>-<version_number>-<release_number>.spec`
- Spec files reference SOURCEs as `Source0`, `Source1`
- Spec file uses `%{variable_name}` to dereference values
  - Variables are case insensitive; e.g. `%{foo}` matches `Foo` variable
```
