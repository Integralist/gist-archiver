<pre><code class="language-markdown">## UPDATE

Every time I accidentally `git commit --amend` instead of a normal git commit I have to google `git reset --soft HEAD@{1}` to save the day.

---

Imagine you have a file called `foo.txt` and your Git history looked like this: 

</code></pre>

<p>A -&gt; B -&gt; C (HEAD)</p>

<pre><code>
Let's see each commit we made:

</code></pre>

<p>A == foo
B == FOO
C == Foo</p>

<pre><code>
The following examples explain the different reset flags:

</code></pre>

<p>git reset &ndash;soft B  == move HEAD to B but keep C&rsquo;s changes staged (i.e. added to the index)</p>

<p>git reset &ndash;mixed B == move HEAD to B but keep C&rsquo;s changes unstaged (&ndash;mixed is the DEFAULT)</p>

<p>git reset &ndash;hard B  == move HEAD to B but completely delete C (you&rsquo;ve lost those changes forever)</p>

<pre><code>
&gt; **NOTE**: If you accidentally `git commit --amend` the `HEAD`, then you can undo that using `git reset --soft HEAD@{1}`. The `--soft` means the changes you made are kept staged (ready for an actual `git commit`) while the `HEAD@{1}` means set `HEAD` to what it was before the accidental `--amend`. This means `HEAD@{1}` is _NOT_ the same thing as `HEAD~1`, which gives you the commit that is the parent node of the commit that `HEAD` is currently pointing to. The reference `HEAD@{1}` is actually able to get back what we want because what it references is actually sourced from `git reflog`, which if you run `git reflog` you'll see the output shows an index for each recorded change.

If you want to clean up a PRs commits, then run:

</code></pre>

<p>git reset origin/main</p>

<pre><code>
Then your changes will still exist, but will just be unstaged (as --mixed is the default behaviour). You can now `git add --patch` cleanly.
