<pre><code class="language-markdown">So I had an interesting problem where I had a block of code like... 

</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;testing0.testing-performance-domain.com&rdquo; = {
  val1 = &ldquo;value_1&rdquo;
  &hellip;
}</p>

<pre><code>
The ... is lots of key/value lines, so it ends up being a large 'block'.

I needed to duplicate the block multiple times (200 in fact) but the first line needed an incremented number, so...

</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;testing1.testing-performance-domain.com&rdquo; = {
  val1 = &ldquo;value_1&rdquo;
  &hellip;
}
&ldquo;testing2.testing-performance-domain.com&rdquo; = {
  val1 = &ldquo;value_1&rdquo;
  &hellip;
}
&ldquo;testing3.testing-performance-domain.com&rdquo; = {
  val1 = &ldquo;value_1&rdquo;
  &hellip;
}</p>

<pre><code>
The way I solved this was to:

- make sure the `&quot;a` register contained `0`.
- `V%y` (copy the block).
- `199P` (duplicate it, as we need two hundred blocks).
- `qq` (on the first line of the first block I record the following macro `0f0v&quot;ap^AvTg&quot;ay`).
  - `0` go to start of the line.
  - `f0` find the first zero (e.g. the zero in `testing0`).
  - `v&quot;ap` select the zero and replace it with the contents of the `&quot;a` register (the first time round this would be the same number: `0`).
  - `^A` press Ctrl-a to increment the number pasted from the register.
    - The cursor is always placed at the end of the number.
    - So if number is 123 then the cursor would be on 3.
  - `vTg` select back to just before the `g` in the preceding word &quot;testing&quot; (i.e. select the new number).
  - `&quot;ay` and yank the new number into the same `&quot;a` register.
- I then reset the first block to zero (so `&quot;testing0.testing-performance-domain.com&quot; = {`)
- `:g/\v^\s\s\s\s&quot;testing\d/norm @q` find all relevant blocks and run the macro.
