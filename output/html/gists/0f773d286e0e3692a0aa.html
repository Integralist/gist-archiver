<pre><code class="language-markdown">**Imperative programming**:  
Telling the &quot;machine&quot; **_how_** to do something, and as a result what you want to happen will happen.  
Go is imperative in nature as some common language abstractions (e.g. `Array#map`) are absent and encourages an explicit imperative programming style.

&gt; **NOTE**: [Procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) is derived from 'imperative' programming and is named as such because it groups instructions into 'procedures'.

**Declarative programming**:  
Telling the &quot;machine&quot; what you would like to happen, and let the computer figure out how to do it.  
Functional Programming and its abstractions (e.g. `Array#map` instead of `for`) allow you to focus on **_what_** we want to happen rather than **_how_** to iterate the object.

**Structured programming**:  
Makes extensive use of subroutines, block structures, `for` and `while` loops.  
Object-Oriented Programming is an extension of this.
