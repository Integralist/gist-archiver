<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Factorials

To identify the various combinations of a number or letter, you need to know the number of items.

So if you're dealing with a string like &quot;ABC&quot;, that's three characters.

So you would say `3!` factorial.

Which really means: `3*2*1 = 6`.

And the reason we multiply backwards from `3` specifically is because there were three characters to begin with.

So we know there are six potential combinations:

1. ABC
2. ACB
3. BAC
4. BCA
5. CAB
6. CBA

But what if you have 10 items?

<p>10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 3,628,800</p>

<pre><code>
You can see that even with a small number of items, the number of possible combinations becomes very large.

## Exponents

An exponent is made up of two numbers: a &quot;base&quot; and a &quot;power&quot; (also referred to as an &quot;exponent&quot;, but I prefer &quot;power&quot; as it helps to distinguish the second number from the over-arching concept of exponents).

Typically the power is displayed as a superscript, but as that not always the easiest thing to type in different editors there is also a symbol to represent an exponent: `^`.

</code></pre>

<p>3^4 = 3*3*3*3</p>

<pre><code>
&gt; Note: strictly speaking the small (superscript) number is the &quot;exponent&quot;, while the larger number is the &quot;base&quot;. The base multiplying itself a number times (specifically by whatever number the exponent is set to) will _result_ in what's called &quot;raising to the power&quot; (the &quot;power&quot; is the resulting number). -- see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation
