<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Key Points

- the product direction should drive the type of work that we prioritize.
- take an 'outside in' approach (`user -&gt; brand/product -&gt; software -&gt; infrastructure`)

## Example

Fixing a deployment pipeline might be useful as part of your teams commitment to sustainable (†) software, but does it contribute to the overall impact your team is having on reaching the goal of promoting the business/product?

&gt; † notice we don't refer to &quot;tech debt&quot; but the &quot;sustainability&quot; of our software.

## Rationale

Thinking about the end users and the services we're offering isn't something a lot of engineers worry about. They have their own interests and agendas. Technology and implementation seems to take primary focus.

We should encourage a Netflix mentality of 'get on board, or get off'. It's not about firing people or pushing good people out the door. It's about ensuring everyone working at the organization is focused on making the business a success and dropping their egos at the door each morning.

If the business is successful, then YOU will be successful.

If the business is NOT successful, then you'll have the greatest software and tools in the world that no one uses (and you'll soon find the company goes under).
