<pre><code class="language-markdown">- **Continuous Integration**: testing every commit
- **Continuous Delivery**: every change is shippable on demand
- **Continuous Deployment**: shipping every change automatically

Delivery and Deployment are two terms that often are confused with each other. The 'delivery' variation requires a human to press a button that triggers the deployment, while the 'deployment' variation removes the need for human interaction and will automatically deploy the software once it is merged (e.g. once the 'integration' step has passed successfully).
