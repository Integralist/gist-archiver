## PUT

Use PUT when you can update a resource completely through a specific resource. For instance, if you know that an article resides at http://example.org/article/1234, you can PUT a new resource representation of this article directly through a PUT on this URL.

## POST

If you do not know the actual resource location, for instance, when you add a new article, but do not have any idea where to store it, you can POST it to an URL, and let the server decide the actual URL.

&gt; Note: there must always be a body param passed to the server when executing a POST or a PUT operation. Meaning you only pass enough information in the URL to identify the resource and not including any data for that resource. For example, this is bad: `/user/&lt;id&gt;/username/&lt;new_username&gt;` but this is ok: `/user/&lt;id&gt;/username` upon which you'll then pass the new username as the body param: `curl --method PUT --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{&quot;username&quot;: &quot;foobar&quot;}' https://api.example.com/user/id/123/username`.
