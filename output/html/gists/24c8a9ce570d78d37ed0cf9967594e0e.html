<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Situation, Behaviour, Impact

## Situation

**Goal**: provide context.

- **Who** was there?
- **Where** was it?
- **When** was it?

## Behaviour

**Goal**: recognise	what they _did_ or _didn't_ do.

- **What** did they do that should be continued or changed?
- **What** was the behaviour that occurred?

## Impact

**Goal**: understand the importance of feedback.

- **How** did it effect them, you, the team or the company?

# Key Take-Aways to keep in mind

- **Avoid common biases**: Let's check our biases (Negative, Halo, and Similarity) at the door. Reviews should be fair and impartial.
- **Keep feedback objective and focused on the big picture**: Relate feedback to the overall expectations of the position by using SBI; situation, behavior, impact.
- **Partner with your HRBP or manager**: Don't go at it alone! Schedule time with me or your manager if you need help with talking points, addressing feedback, or you just need to bounce your thoughts off someone.
