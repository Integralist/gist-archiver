<pre><code class="language-markdown">I'm trying to get the domain `www.markandcat.co.uk` pointing to the repository: http://integralist.github.com/Mark-and-Cat/

Looking at the help pages on GitHub the first thing it says to do is to upload a `CNAME` file with your domain name (in this case `markandcat.co.uk`) and this I've done.

The next step apparently is to set-up a CNAME record via your domain registrar (in this case `123-reg`) and looking at 123-reg's DNS page (http://cl.ly/321S0S41121S200f0l1T) what would I need to set and where? As I assumed that I would need to first set the A record 'www' hostname to point to the Github ip (which as you can see I've done) and since then - as you can see in the attached image - I've added a CNAME record with its hostname set to `www` and it's value set to `integralist.github.com.` (the value was forced by 123-reg as `integralist.github.com/Mark-and-Cat/` was invalid) - so I'm not sure how GitHub knows what repo to point the domain to (I'm assuming it will try and sent the domain to the repo integralist.github.com)?
