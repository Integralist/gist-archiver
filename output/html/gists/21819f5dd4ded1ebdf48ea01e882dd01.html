<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Questions to ask yourself?

- What's _important_ to me (what are my priorities and standards)?
- What impact can _I_ have here?

## Questions for them?

It's a good idea, at the start of any conversation, to ask:

&gt; What's the focus of today's conversation?  

i.e. What's important to `&lt;COMPANY&gt;`, and what insights do _you_ want to take from this?

- **What's `&lt;COMPANY&gt;`'s story?**  
  - Give me an insight into the company's history/background and how we've reached this point in time.

- **Presence**  
  - How many offices do you have and what are their locality?

- **Culture and Diversity**  
  - The company's &quot;values&quot; will help indicate what's _important_ to them.

- **Hierarchy and Organisation Structure**
  - Are you fairly 'flat and lean' or 'tall and fragmented'?

- **Visibility &amp; Openness**
  - How does leadership share and handle critical/internal business topics?

- **Collaboration**
  - Features across teams (avoiding duplication)
  - Timezones

- **Community**
  - How do internal &amp; external staff interact?
  - How do teams across offices/locality bond?

- **Process**
  - New Features
  - Leadership
  - Documentation (sharing of information, no silos of knowledge)
  - Post mortems (blameless retrospection, handling of failures)
  - Tech Debt

- **Communication**
  - [SBI: Situation, Behaviour, Impact](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/24c8a9ce570d78d37ed0cf9967594e0e) (Methodology, _The Center for Creative Leadership_)
  - [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) (Book, _Kim Scott_)
  - [Conscious Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdMvWLARF1w) (Video, _Fred Kofman_)
  - [Authentic Communication](https://www.soundstrue.com/store/authentic-communication.html) (Book, _Fred Kofman_)

- **Responsibility and Ownership**
  - Site Reliability
  - Operations
  - On-call rota

- **Job Progression &amp; Opportunities**
  - Learning budgets?
  - Conferences?

- **Remote Working**
  - How are remotes kept feeling inclusiveness?

- **Work life balance and support**
  - How do staff balance work-life, when in a multi-region organisation?
  - e.g. cross-over hours between UK and US?

- **Tech**
  - Infrastructure
  - Build System
  - Deployment Platform
  - Rollback Processes

- **Vision and Future**
  - Where is `&lt;COMPANY&gt;` looking towards?
  - What are the goals?
