## PROBLEM 0: Quick Fix?

Whatever your problem, try restarting your GPG Agent (it will auto-restart the next time gpg is used): 

</code></pre>

<p>gpgconf &ndash;kill gpg-agent
killall gpg-agent</p>

<pre><code>
Also try `GIT_TRACE=1 ...` to see which internal command is failing and try running the command to get at the underlying error. 

## PROBLEM 1: Homebrew changes install locations

My global `~/.gitconfig` had a `[gpg]` section which was configured to the location of the `gpp` binary. I installed a newer Homebrew version (as part of a new laptop setup) and discovered that Homebrew changed the location of where binaries are installed so I needed to `which gpg` to find the new location and update my global git config.

## PROBLEM 2: New Laptop

I pulled down a project from GitHub but forgot that originally (on my old laptop) I would have updated the project's local `.git/config` file to include my user details, and the fact I want to sign my commits (see &quot;Project Specific Summary&quot; below). So just make sure that data is added.

## PROBLEM 3: Missing GPG_TTY

I was finding, after a long time of being able to sign commits using the instructions from this gist, that I couldn't sign my commits all of a sudden. 

There's a few things you can try.

In one instance I needed an esoteric way to tell Git about my user...

```bash
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="problem-4-conflicting-branch-names">PROBLEM 4: Conflicting branch names</h2>

<p>Another issue I found was I shouldn&rsquo;t have a branch named the same as the tag version because git won&rsquo;t know what to do (make sure to delete the branch if it&rsquo;s already merged into your primary branch, or rename it otherwise). So now I don&rsquo;t name my branches <code>v1.0.0</code> but <code>integralist/v1.0.0</code> as this means when I add the tag <code>v1.0.0</code> there&rsquo;s no confusion as to what&rsquo;s being referenced.</p>

<p>If your GPG key expires then you can&rsquo;t just update the expiry. You need to delete the public key from your GitHub account and re-add it in the GitHub UI like you did when first creating the public key (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/updating-an-expired-gpg-key" target="_blank">docs</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: feel free to add <code>gpgsign</code> to global settings if you prefer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to generate the public key to paste into GitHub. First get the identifier&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG

sec   4096R/&lt;GRAB_THIS&gt; ...
...
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can export your public key&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">gpg --armor --export &lt;identifier&gt; | pbcopy
</code></pre>

<p>Then go to GitHub &gt; Settings &gt; SSH and GPG keys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If using a different email to what your GitHub account is associated with, then go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails" target="_blank">https://github.com/settings/emails</a> and add the new email so it can be verified (otherwise github won&rsquo;t verify the email in the gpg key).</p>

<p>See the ~/.gnupg/ files in <a href="https://github.com/integralist/dotfiles" target="_blank">my dotfiles repo</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
</code></pre>

<h2 id="changing-commit-author">Changing Commit Author</h2>

<p>If like me you have multiple users (one work, one personal) then you might want to change a personal commit signing with a work identity if you had used your personal one by accident.</p>

<p>To do that you can use:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git commit --amend --reset-author
</code></pre>
