<pre><code class="language-markdown">##JavaScript specific Questions

* Which JavaScript libraries have you used?
* How is JavaScript different from Java?
* What are undefined and undeclared variables?
* What is an expression?
* What is a statement?
* Give an example of a function declaration
* Give an example of a function expression
* Explain what the DOM is and some best practices for interacting with it.
* What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?
* What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?
* Explain the &quot;JavaScript module pattern&quot; and when you'd use it.
* How do you organize your code? (AMD, module pattern, classical inheritance)
* What's the difference between host objects and native objects?
* Explain Function.prototype.bind?
* When do you optimize your code?
* Can you explain how inheritance works in JavaScript?
* When would you use document.write()?
* What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?
* Explain AJAX in as much detail as possible
* Explain how JSONP works?
* Have you ever used JavaScript templating, and if so, what/how?
* Explain &quot;hoisting&quot;.
* What is FOUC? How do you avoid FOUC?
* Describe event bubbling.
* What's the difference between an &quot;attribute&quot; and a &quot;property&quot;?
* Why is extending host objects not a good idea?
* Difference between document load event and document ready event?
* What is the difference between == and ===?
* Explain how you would get a query string parameter from the browser window's URL.
* Explain event delegation.
* Describe inheritance patterns in JavaScript.
* Describe a strategy for memoization (avoiding calculation repetition) in JavaScript.
* What's the best way to handle lots of arguments passed to a function?
* Have you used the Canvas element and if so what did you use it for?
* How do you debug errors in your code?
* Do you validate your code and if so what tools do you use?
* Show us how you would get the internal class of a native object, specifically an Array (e.g. `typeof [1, 2, 3]` results in 'object' which is incorrect, we want to get the actual class value which should be 'Array').
* Write a quick events library that abstracts the basic 'add' and 'remove' event listeners so they work across multiple browsers (specifically needs to work with Internet Explorer)
* Write a quick function which lets an object inherit the methods and properties from another object (you can use either an inheritance pattern or a composite pattern).
* Write a quick function which demonstrates the 'module pattern' (this pattern keeps variables and methods private and can also provide an API to allow another user to access the internal methods via 'privileged' methods).
* Write a quick function which allows the user to specify an element and to add a class to that element (being careful not to overwrite the existing classes or adding the same class twice).
* Write a quick function that truncates a String of text which is over 30 characters long (e.g. if the String of text is over 30 characters then the text is shortened to 30 characters and a '...' placed at the end to show the text has been shortened)
* What are some best practices when using a framework such as jQuery?
* What's wrong with the following jQuery code? (extra points for pointing out other issues with the HTML - inc. best practices and performance):
