<pre><code class="language-markdown">There are many 'motions' and things you can do but I would probably say there are some essential motions you'll use a lot...

- `:&lt;LINE_NUMBER&gt;` to jump to a specific line number (e.g. `:10`)
- `gg` to go to the top of the file (`G` to go to the bottom)
- `Ctrl+d` to go down half a page (`Ctrl+u` to go up half a page)
- `{` and `}` to jump back and forth between paragraphs
- `f&lt;CHARACTER&gt;` to jump forward on the current line to a specific character (use `F` to search backwards in the line).
- `^` to go to the start of the line (`0` if you want to specifically go back to the zero column)
- `$` to go to the end of the line
- `/&lt;PATTERN&gt;` to search for text in the current buffer (see https://www.vimregex.com/ or use `\v` flag to make regexes a bit more sane, e.g. `/\v&lt;PATTERN`)

The typical structure for doing something like &quot;delete the text inside parentheses&quot; is... &quot;operation, placement, pattern&quot; (not sure if that's the correct terminology to use, I've not had to think about that sort of stuff in a long time ðŸ˜…) but an example would be `di(` where `d` is the operation (i.e. delete), `i` is the placement (i.e. inside), `(` is the pattern (i.e. the parenthesis).

For the &quot;operation&quot;: you have `d` for delete, `v` for select, `c` for change.

For the &quot;placement&quot;: you have `i` for inside, `a` for around.

**Example:** if I have the text `myFunction(something)` and my cursor is inside the parentheses then I can do...

- `ci(` to remove the text inside the parentheses and put me into `INSERT` mode so I can type new text 
- `vi(` to select the text inside the parentheses, where I can then `y` to &quot;yank&quot; the text into my clipboard
- `di(` to get `myFunction()` 
- `da(` to get `myFunction`

Of course there's a lifetime of motions/movement/modal stuff you can learn but I'd definitely say the above is my &quot;bread and butter&quot; of things I use a lot (outside of features from plugins).

Good luck!
