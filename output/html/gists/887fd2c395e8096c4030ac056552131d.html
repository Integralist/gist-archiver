<pre><code class="language-markdown">Look at a recent bill for the cost of 1 kilowatt-hour.

e.g. 13p

There are 1000 watts in a kilowatt.

To calculate kilowatt of an appliance: `watt / kilowatt`.

e.g. 40 watt fan = `40 รท 1000` = 0.04

&gt; If the appliance doesn't include watts, you can multiply the volts by the amps to get watts.

Now multiply that value by 13 (the cost of a kwh)

e.g. 0.04 x 13 = 0.52p an hour (that's half a penny).

Multiply that value by the number of hours you expect the appliance to run.

e.g. 8 hours means 0.52 x 8 = 4.16

This means: running the appliance for 8hrs will cost you just over 4 pence.
