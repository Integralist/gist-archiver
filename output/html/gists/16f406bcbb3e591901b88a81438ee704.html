<h2 id="python-tox-explanation-md">Python Tox Explanation.md</h2>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">Tox is a tool that creates virtual environments, and installs the configured dependencies for those environments, for the purpose of testing a Python package (i.e. something that will be shared via PyPi, and so it only works with code that defines a `setup.py`).

The file that you use to configure tox can be one of the following...

&gt; Note: these are all [ini file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) formats.

- `tox.ini`
- `pyproject.toml` (see [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/))
- `setup.cfg` (see [official guide to distributing packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/))

All configuration options for tox can be found here:
[tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html)

## Example tox.ini

&gt; Note: the name after `testenv:` is the _name_ of the virtual environment that will be created (e.g. `testenv:foo` will create a &quot;foo&quot; virtual environment).

```ini
[tox]
envlist = 
    py37, lint
toxworkdir = 
    {env:TOX_WORK_DIR}

[testenv]
setenv =
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE = 1
whitelist_externals =
    /bin/bash
deps = 
    -rrequirements-dev.txt
commands =
    py.test --cov={envsitepackagesdir}/bf_tornado -m &quot;not integration&quot;

[testenv:dev]
usedevelop=True
recreate = False
commands =
    # to run arbitrary commands: tox -e dev -- bash
    {posargs:py.test --cov=bf_tornado}

[testenv:lint]
deps = flake8==3.7.9
commands =
    flake8 bf_tornado

<h2 id="configuring-other-packages">Configuring <em>other</em> packages</h2>

<p>A <code>tox.ini</code> file can be used to configure different types of packages, which is confusing at first because the tox home page suggests that tox is used to test <em>your own</em> packages you plan on distributing to PyPi.</p>

<p>What is meant by that is the <code>tox</code> command itself is used to handle testing your packages, while the <code>tox.ini</code> <em>configuration file</em> is just one such file that can be used to contain configuration information.</p>

<p>This is why other packages, such as <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">Flake8</a> allow you to <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html" target="_blank">configure it</a> using the <code>tox.ini</code> file (or alternatively either <code>setup.cfg</code> or <code>.flake8</code> files can be used).</p>

<p>The key to understanding why this works is as so: each of these files conforms to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file" target="_blank">ini file</a> format. So you&rsquo;re free to use whatever file &lsquo;name&rsquo; you feel best suits your project, while the format of the file will stay consistent to what is expected of an <code>.ini</code> file.</p>

<p>Below is an example that shows various Python packages being configured within a <code>tox.ini</code> file.</p>

<p>In case it&rsquo;s unclear, the configuration inside of the <code>tox.ini</code> file is used instead of having to pass those configuration values via the command line. So in the case of a tool such as <code>flake8</code>, instead of using <code>flake8 --max-line-length=120</code> you could just call <code>flake8</code> and the flag value is extracted from the configuration file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ini">[flake8]
max_line_length = 120
ignore = E261,E265,E402  # http://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes

[coverage:run]
branch = True

[coverage:report]
show_missing = True
exclude_lines =
    raise NotImplementedError
    return NotImplemented
    def __repr__
omit = bf_tornado/testing.py

[pytest]
addopts = 
    --strict -p no:cacheprovider --showlocals
markers =
    integration: mark a test as an integration test that makes http calls.
