<pre><code class="language-markdown">&gt; **NOTE**: few people affected.  
&gt; **IMPORTANT**: lots of people affected.  
&gt; **HINT**: examples and use cases, but could just be omitted.  
&gt; **WARNING**: avoid doing something dangerous.

If it doesnâ€™t fit, then maybe it should be part of the content.

## Example of not using aside

The message you want to get across is: &quot;you should use an API key but you can call this particular endpoint without one&quot;.

The message affects everyone so you might think to use an `IMPORTANT` aside, but this doesn't feel important enough to be an aside, so just include it in the main content.
