<title>Ruby: pass a block to a function that has zero arity (i.e. don't define &block inside of our initialize method). The point of this demonstration is that you are able to pass a block through to another method whilst not initially defining an argument for the block to be passed by. This way we gain better performance (calling a proc is very slow compared to yielding), and regardless we're not able to pass a yield through to another method.</title>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">I saw this in some code written by BBC principle developer @kenoir and later located the following useful post: http://mudge.name/2011/01/26/passing-blocks-in-ruby-without-block.html

```ruby
class Foo
  def initialize
    bar &amp;Proc.new # voodoo
  end
  def bar(&amp;block)
    block.call
  end
end

Foo.new { puts &quot;hai&quot; }
</code></pre>

<p>In short, the reason it works is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If <code>Proc.new</code> is called from inside a method without any arguments of its own, it will return a new Proc containing the block given to its surrounding method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very nice!
