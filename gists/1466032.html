<p>We are looking for a full-time &lsquo;front-end&rsquo; web developer to join our expanding digital media team.</p>

<p>The candidate needs to be enthusiastic, proactive and passionate about programming. And, as well as having a killer set of skills already, you will need to want to learn new talents, understand the latest web development technologies and get to grips with the latest programming languages.</p>

<p>Although much of the work will be ‘backroom’, there will also be times when you will need to liaise directly with clients – in person, over the phone and by email – to help them with issues directly, so outstanding communication skills are also a must.</p>

<p>Finally, as part of our growing team, you will need to work well with other people, as well as take responsibility for your own work within specific projects.</p>

<hr />

<p>We need someone who is highly skilled in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Solid JavaScript knowledge is essential. As modern web applications are now starting to blur the boundaries of what can be achieved and making applications feel more &lsquo;desktop like&rsquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>e.g. Ajax, DOM manipulation, cross browser implementations etc, ideally without a framework!</p>

<p>Not using a framework would be ideal as it&rsquo;ll demonstrate you understand the actual language itself.</p>

<p>But we have been known to use jQuery on some projects too.</p>

<p>You should be able to determine when it&rsquo;s best to use a framework and when not to, and we expect as part of your skills to know the pitfalls/best practices of the library.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Strong CSS skills</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We use OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS) as a way to better manage the layout and structure or our websites/applications.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Experience utilising some of the new features of HTML5 (we appreciate that this is a bit of a &lsquo;loaded&rsquo; term, which means more than what HTML5 strictly covers - such as SVG, CSS 3, CORS, Geolocation etc - but your passion for technology will mean you are aware of these intricacies)</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>In addition, the following technical skills are not required but would be to the successful candidate’s advantage:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>AMD/Modular JavaScript (we use RequireJs for loading our AMD modules)</p></li>

<li><p>Performance and optimisation experience/knowledge</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Knowing how best to load page assets (and when) and how to enhance a page</p>

<p>Validating and linting your code (and knowing when not to get too strict about it)</p>

<p>Target the key rules of YSlow and Google Page Speed.</p>

<p>CSS spriting</p>

<p>JavaScript optimisation (knowing not to just make micro-optimisations for the sake of it)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Mobile</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge/experience with the different routes to making (or converting) a website to be mobile</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Regular Expressions</p></li>

<li><p>Understand the MVC design pattern (and/or other design patterns) and how/when to utilise them.</p></li>

<li><p>Version Control (we use the Git Version Control system)</p></li>

<li><p>Active Github account (someone who likes to hack and share what they do)</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Responsibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>Report any issues (technical or otherwise) to your line manager</li>
<li>All projects should have a technical specification of functionality written up for client approval before development begins - which you will either handle yourself or work with a back-end team member if there are server/database related technologies involved for the project.</li>
<li>Pro actively discuss new ideas and techniques with your colleagues (being passionate about technology you&rsquo;ll be excited to share what you&rsquo;ve learnt)</li>
<li>Be understanding. Sometimes a client can make a poor judgement/decision. We will always advise our clients of our recommended solution, but if the client chooses to ignore our advice then so be it - accept it and move on.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Salary is negotiable depending on what skills you have and the skills you&rsquo;re missing. But don&rsquo;t worry if you feel like you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;tick all the boxes&rdquo;, you may have enough for us to find a place for you in our team!</p>
