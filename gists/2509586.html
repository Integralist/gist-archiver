<li>What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s a typical use case for anonymous functions?</li>

<li>What&rsquo;s the difference between host objects and native objects?</li>
<li>Explain Function.prototype.bind?</li>
<li>When do you optimize your code?</li>
<li>Can you explain how inheritance works in JavaScript?</li>

<li>Explain &ldquo;hoisting&rdquo;.</li>
<li>What is FOUC? How do you avoid FOUC?</li>
<li>Describe event bubbling.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the difference between an &ldquo;attribute&rdquo; and a &ldquo;property&rdquo;?</li>
<li>Why is extending host objects not a good idea?</li>
<li>Difference between document load event and document ready event?</li>
<li>What is the difference between == and ===?</li>
<li>Explain how you would get a query string parameter from the browser window&rsquo;s URL.</li>

<li>What&rsquo;s the best way to handle lots of arguments passed to a function?</li>
<li>Have you used the Canvas element and if so what did you use it for?</li>
<li>How do you debug errors in your code?</li>
<li>Do you validate your code and if so what tools do you use?</li>
<li>Show us how you would get the internal class of a native object, specifically an Array (e.g. <code>typeof [1, 2, 3]</code> results in &lsquo;object&rsquo; which is incorrect, we want to get the actual class value which should be &lsquo;Array&rsquo;).</li>
<li>Write a quick events library that abstracts the basic &lsquo;add&rsquo; and &lsquo;remove&rsquo; event listeners so they work across multiple browsers (specifically needs to work with Internet Explorer)</li>
<li>Write a quick function which lets an object inherit the methods and properties from another object (you can use either an inheritance pattern or a composite pattern).</li>
<li>Write a quick function which demonstrates the &lsquo;module pattern&rsquo; (this pattern keeps variables and methods private and can also provide an API to allow another user to access the internal methods via &lsquo;privileged&rsquo; methods).</li>
<li>Write a quick function which allows the user to specify an element and to add a class to that element (being careful not to overwrite the existing classes or adding the same class twice).</li>
<li>Write a quick function that truncates a String of text which is over 30 characters long (e.g. if the String of text is over 30 characters then the text is shortened to 30 characters and a &lsquo;&hellip;&rsquo; placed at the end to show the text has been shortened)</li>
<li>What are some best practices when using a framework such as jQuery?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s wrong with the following jQuery code? (extra points for pointing out other issues with the HTML - inc. best practices and performance):</li>
