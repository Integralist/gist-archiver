The former requires a service to know about its upstream services.

The latter allows a service to _not_ know about its upstream services.

The latter is a cleaner separation of concerns and decoupling, because the upstream services just need to be aware of a potential &quot;event&quot; and the original service just needs to know that it has to fire an &quot;event&quot;.
