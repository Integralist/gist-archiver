<h2 id="master">Master</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;master&rdquo; is a cluster-wide set of services (such as the API server, which <code>kubectl</code> interacts with) which allow Kubernetes to manage our cluster of Nodes.</p>

<h2 id="node">Node</h2>

<p>Nodes run pods. Nodes are also managed by the master services.</p>

<p>Each Node needs a Kubelet. The master sends orders to the kubelet which it uses to interact with pod containers.</p>

<p>Each Node also needs a proxy which provides simple load balancing (kube-proxy)</p>

<h2 id="pods">Pods</h2>

<p>Pods are groups of containers, co-located on the same host.</p>

<p>Each Pod gets its own dedicated IP (these IPs change as pods are created/killed).</p>

<p>Pods can be assigned labels.</p>

<h2 id="replication-controllers">Replication Controllers</h2>

<p>RCs handle the lifecycle of the pods, ensuring they match the specification.</p>

<p>If there are too few, it&rsquo;ll create more. If there are too many, it&rsquo;ll kill those over the threshold.</p>

<h2 id="services">Services</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Services are collections of pods that are exposed with a single and stable name and network address. The service provides load balancing to the underlying pods, with or without an external load balancer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Services are an abstraction. They define a way of accessing a set of pods.</p>

<p>In a practical sense, a &lsquo;service&rsquo; is a REST endpoint, created by POST&rsquo;ing a definition file to the Kubernetes &ldquo;API server&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;Service&quot;,
    &quot;apiVersion&quot;: &quot;v1&quot;,
    &quot;metadata&quot;: {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;my-service&quot;
    },
    &quot;spec&quot;: {
        &quot;selector&quot;: {
            &quot;app&quot;: &quot;MyApp&quot;
        },
        &quot;ports&quot;: [
            {
                &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;TCP&quot;,
                &quot;port&quot;: 80,
                &quot;targetPort&quot;: 9376
            }
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The pods targeted by a service, are done so by utilising labels (in the above example our service is grouping together a set of pods that have been labelled <code>MyApp</code>).</p>

<p>If a set of pods come up and down, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that their ip addresses have changed because our new &lsquo;service&rsquo; (abstraction) hides this detail and gives us a single entry point to access the pods the service manages.</p>

<p>The service is given an ip address (also known as a &ldquo;cluster IP&rdquo;) allowing other nodes/pods to query it in order to locate other pods.</p>

<h2 id="labels">Labels</h2>

<p>These are key-value pairs.</p>

<p>Replication Controllers use them for &ldquo;service discovery&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="volumes">Volumes</h2>

<p>A volume is a directory, mounted into a container for the purpose of storing state.</p>

<h2 id="kubectl">Kubectl</h2>

<p>Command line tool, which allows you to: add/delete Nodes, Pods and Replication Controllers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="local-set-up">Local Set-up</h2>

<p>A local set-up requires creating a &ldquo;standalone cluster&rdquo;</p>
