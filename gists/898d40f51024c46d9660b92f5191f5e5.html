<ul>
<li><strong>CPU bound</strong>: the rate at which a process progresses is limited by the speed of the CPU.</li>
<li><strong>I/O bound</strong>: the rate at which a process progresses is limited by the speed of the I/O subsystem.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means a task that performs calculations on a small set of numbers, for example multiplying small matrices, is likely to be CPU bound. While a task that processes data from disk, for example, counting the number of lines in a file is likely to be I/O bound.</p>

<p>A program is CPU bound if it would go faster if the CPU were faster.</p>

<p>A program is I/O bound if it would go faster if the I/O subsystem was faster.</p>
