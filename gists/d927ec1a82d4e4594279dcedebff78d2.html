<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: all information learned from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html" target="_blank">https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html</a></p>

<p>Understanding ownership requires understanding &lsquo;stack&rsquo; vs &lsquo;heap&rsquo; memory.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stack data is released once it goes out of scope (e.g. once a function ends the arguments passed are dropped).</li>
<li>Stack is quick because the values are literal and can be hardcoded into the compiled binary.</li>
<li>This means stack values are immutable.</li>
<li>Heap is for memory that grows or has unknown size and needs to be explicitly dropped.</li>
<li>Heap is slower as it is allocated at <em>runtime</em> and you have to follow a &lsquo;pointer&rsquo; to find the data in heap memory.</li>
<li>Rust primitive/scalar types (int, bool, float, char, string literal etc) are stored in stack memory.</li>
<li>Most other complex types (String, Box etc.) are stored into heap memory.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<ul>
<li>Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its <em>owner</em>.</li>
<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

<ul>
<li>Primitive types are popped from the stack memory automatically when out of scope.</li>
<li>Complex types must implement a <code>drop</code> function which Rust will call when out of scope (to explicitly deallocate heap memory).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>Primitive types are &lsquo;copied&rsquo; (<code>a = 1; b = a</code>) because they exist in stack memory and are known size (i.e. cheap to copy).

<ul>
<li>Primitive types have a <code>Copy</code> trait that enable this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Complex types &lsquo;move&rsquo; ownership (<code>a = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); b = a</code>).

<ul>
<li>Complex types <em>do not</em> have a <code>Copy</code> trait (which is a common error).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One an owner changes, the previous owner cannot be reused (e.g. you can&rsquo;t reference the previous owner variable in a print statement after ownership has changed).</li>
<li>To allow an owner to stay an owner, you&rsquo;d need to &lsquo;clone&rsquo; the complex type (e.g <code>a = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); b = a.clone()</code>) which will actually duplicate the heap memory (so it&rsquo;s not cheap!).</li>
<li>Passing a variable (i.e. owner) to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does.</li>
<li>Returning values can also transfer ownership.

<ul>
<li>Returning a complex type will move ownership to the caller (and the variable the result is assigned to becomes the new owner).</li>
<li>In this scenario <code>drop</code> is not called, even if the owner was created within the function, as would normally be the case if a variable went out of scope at the end of the function.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="borrowing">Borrowing</h2>

<p>NOTE: all information learned from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html" target="_blank">https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. To prevent this you can pass a &lsquo;reference&rsquo; to a complex type (e.g. function <code>foo(s: &amp;String)</code> and caller <code>foo(&amp;a)</code>).</p>

<p>In the above example the <code>s</code> variable will (depending on function implementation) go out of scope, and yet nothing will happen (i.e. it won&rsquo;t be dropped) because the function doesn&rsquo;t <em>own</em> what <code>s</code> refers to.</p>

<p>In order to mutate something borrowed, the caller and the receiver need to define the type as a &lsquo;mutable&rsquo; type:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    change(&amp;mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &amp;mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(&quot;, world&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="gotchas-1">Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can have only one mutable reference (i.e. this prevents data races).</li>
<li>You can have multiple mutable references only if the scope allows for it.

<ul>
<li>e.g. <code>{let a = &amp;mut s;} let b = &amp;mut s;</code> (as <code>a</code> will go out of scope before <code>b</code> is reached).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Multiple immutable references is safe.</li>
<li>We cannot have a mutable reference <em>while</em> we have an immutable one (as this otherwise could change the value of the immutable reference).</li>
<li>A reference&rsquo;s scope is from when it&rsquo;s defined to where it&rsquo;s last used.

<ul>
<li>This means you <em>can</em> define multiple immutable references and a mutable reference as long as the immutable references go out of scope before the mutable reference.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Returning a variable created within function (while it being returned as a reference) isn&rsquo;t allowed because the variable will be dropped once out of scope (this avoids a &lsquo;dangling pointer&rsquo;).

<ul>
<li>You must instead return the variable itself rather than a reference, and this will cause the ownership to be moved instead.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lifetimes">Lifetimes</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: all information learned from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html" target="_blank">https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lifetimes ultimately are coupled to references, hence the compiler uses what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;borrow checker&rdquo; to validate lifetimes (as a &lsquo;reference&rsquo; is a term related to the concept of &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Rust prevents variables from trying to hold references to data that has since gone out of scope (i.e. dangling pointer).</p>

<p>The &lsquo;lifetime&rsquo; of a reference begins when the reference is created and ends when it&rsquo;s last used.</p>

<p>If a function returns a reference that changes depending on some logic (e.g. if X return A else return B, where A/B are two different references) then the borrow checker can&rsquo;t statically analyse if your code is safe as it doesn&rsquo;t know which reference will be returned at runtime.</p>

<p>In those cases we need to add lifetime annotations&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn longest&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
    if x.len() &gt; y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>longest</code> function definition states all references in the signature must have the same lifetime <code>'a</code>.</p>

<p>We’re specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don&rsquo;t adhere to these constraints.</p>

<p>The lifetime named &lsquo;static&rsquo; is a special lifetime. It signals that something has the lifetime of the entire program.</p>

<p>String literals can be assigned the type <code>&amp;'static</code> lifetime annotation as a way to indicate the reference is always alive, i.e. they are baked into the data segment of the final binary.</p>
