<pre><code class="language-markdown">The easiest way to check what 'host' objects are available is to execute the following code:

```js
var global = (function(){return this}()); // http://perfectionkills.com/unnecessarily-comprehensive-look-into-a-rather-insignificant-issue-of-global-objects-creation/

for (props in global) {
    console.log(props); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The following is taken from Cody Lindley&rsquo;s &ldquo;JavaScript Enlightenment&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>As it pertains to web browsers, the most famous of all hosted objects is the interface for working with HTML documents, also known as the DOM. Below, is a method to list all of the objects contained inside the <code>window.document</code> object provided by the browser environment.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">for (props in window.document) {
    console.log(props); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;<em>There is a dividing line between what JavaScript provides (e.g. JavaScript 1.5, ECMA-262, Edition 3 v.s. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript" target="_blank">Mozilla&rsquo;s JavaScript</a>) and what the host environment provides, and these two should not be confused.</em></p>

<p><em>The host environment (e.g. a web browser) that runs JavaScript code typically provides the head object (e.g. <code>window</code> object in web browser) where the native portions of the language are stored along with host objects (e.g. <code>window.location</code> in web browser) and user-defined objects (e.g. the code your write to run in the web browser).</em></p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a web browser manufacturer as the host of the JavaScript interrupter to push forward the version of JavaScript or add future specifications to JavaScript before they have been approved (e.g. Mozilla&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript" target="_blank">Firefox</a> JavaScript 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.8.1, 1.8.5).</em>&rdquo;
