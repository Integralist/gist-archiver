    // doesn't allow us to pass arguments to the specified 'action').

    // NOTE: You can't use the ? operator within an async block as a closure can't bubble up the

    // we do another spawn later we'd then try and move it when it has already been moved. I didn't
    // realise that it would be moved because I was calling .clone() and so expected the cloned
    // instance to be moved, but it kinda makes sense that the variable itself is moved.

    // real project I'm trying to include Retry::spawn into.

    // Demonstrating the same as above, but additionally the use of a closure to allow us to pass
    // arguments to the Retry::spawn 'action'.
    //
    // NOTE: If the argument value 123 passed to something_with_an_arg was a complex type (e.g. a
    // type that doesn't implement Copy), then this would cause an error related to the closure
    // implementing FnOnce and not the required FnMut (that Retry::spawn expects). See here
    // https://stackoverflow.com/a/30232500/14849316 explanation of FnOnce, FnMut and Fn. But in
    // essence we might be moving a type from the closure's environment into the
    // something_with_an_arg and that would mean it's FnOnce. The solution would be to change the
    // signature for something_with_an_arg to accept a reference so we pass a reference as the
    // argument type and thus the closure becomes FnMut because it doesn't move any variables.

    // can't be used again after this point in the code (see above `clone_strategy` variables).
