                I'm not sure why the property would have not set when calling the parent constructor, but for whatever reason it wouldn't work until I moved the call after the properties?

            For it to work how we want it to we need to overwrite the `display_location` method completely.
            We can't use parent::display_location(); inside of the redefined method because the scope/context still changes to the Child class.
            So we literally need to have a duplicate of the `display_location` method.

            Really the best thing to do here would be to not use a constant (as it's not actually a constant value if it changes between classes!) 
            Instead we should have used a protected property.
