<h1 id="tls-certificate-and-acme-glossary-1">TLS, Certificate, and ACME Glossary</h1>

<p>This glossary defines common terms related to Transport Layer Security (TLS),
digital certificates, Certificate Authorities (CAs), and the Automatic
Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol. It&rsquo;s intended to help users
understand the concepts involved in securing services and using APIs that manage
certificate issuance, particularly focusing on Subject Alternative Names (SANs).</p>

<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>

<p><strong>TLS (Transport Layer Security):</strong> The successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
A cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a
computer network. TLS ensures privacy and data integrity between two
communicating applications, most commonly seen securing HTTPS web traffic.</p>

<p><strong>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):</strong> The predecessor protocol to TLS. While the term
&ldquo;SSL&rdquo; is still sometimes used colloquially, modern secure connections use TLS.
SSL versions are deprecated due to known vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><strong>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):</strong> The secure version of HTTP,
where communications are encrypted using TLS. It ensures that data exchanged
between a user&rsquo;s browser and a web server is confidential and integral.</p>

<p><strong>Encryption:</strong> The process of converting information or data into a code,
especially to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key Cryptography):</strong> Uses a pair of keys: a
public key (shared freely) for encryption and a private key (kept secret) for
decryption. Used during the TLS handshake to establish a shared secret.</li>
<li><strong>Symmetric Encryption:</strong> Uses the same secret key for both encryption and
decryption. Used for the bulk data transfer during a TLS session because it&rsquo;s
faster than asymmetric encryption.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Handshake (TLS Handshake):</strong> The process at the beginning of a TLS session
where the client and server agree on the protocol version, select cipher suites,
authenticate each other (optionally, server authentication is most common), and
establish shared secret keys for the session.</p>

<p><strong>Cipher Suite:</strong> A named combination of cryptographic algorithms used during a
TLS session. It typically includes algorithms for key exchange, bulk encryption,
and message authentication (MAC). Example: <code>TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code>.</p>

<h2 id="certificate-details">Certificate Details</h2>

<p><strong>Certificate (Digital Certificate / TLS Certificate / X.509 Certificate):</strong> An
electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key. It binds a
public key to an identity (like a hostname or organization) and is signed by a
trusted Certificate Authority (CA). It follows the X.509 standard format.</p>

<p><strong>X.509:</strong> The standard defining the format of public key certificates. Most TLS
certificates are X.509 certificates.</p>

<p><strong>Key Pair:</strong> The combination of a public key and its corresponding private key
used in asymmetric cryptography.</p>

<p><strong>Public Key:</strong> The key in an asymmetric key pair that can be shared publicly
without compromising security. It&rsquo;s typically used to encrypt data intended for
the private key holder or to verify a digital signature made with the private
key.</p>

<p><strong>Private Key:</strong> The key in an asymmetric key pair that <em>must</em> be kept secret by
the owner. It&rsquo;s used to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key
or to create digital signatures. Compromise of the private key compromises the
security of the certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> The field in a certificate that identifies the entity (e.g., domain
name, organization) the certificate belongs to. It contains several components,
including the Common Name (CN).</p>

<p><strong>Common Name (CN):</strong> A component within the Subject field of a certificate.
Historically, it was the primary field used to identify the hostname the
certificate was issued for. <em>Note: Modern browsers and clients primarily rely on
the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field instead.</em></p>

<p><strong>Subject Alternative Name (SAN):</strong> An extension field in an X.509 certificate
(since X.509v3) that allows multiple identifiers (like DNS names, IP addresses,
email addresses) to be bound to the same certificate. <strong>This is the standard and
required way to specify the hostnames a certificate should be valid for.</strong> A
single certificate can secure multiple domains (e.g., <code>example.com</code>,
<code>www.example.com</code>, <code>api.example.com</code>) using SAN entries.</p>

<p><strong>Issuer:</strong> The field in a certificate that identifies the entity (usually a CA)
that signed and issued the certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Signature (Digital Signature):</strong> Data appended to a message (or certificate)
created using the signer&rsquo;s private key. It allows anyone with the corresponding
public key to verify the authenticity and integrity of the message (or
certificate) and confirm the signer&rsquo;s identity. CAs sign the certificates they
issue.</p>

<p><strong>Validity Period:</strong> The time frame during which a certificate is considered
valid. Defined by a &lsquo;Not Before&rsquo; date/time and a &lsquo;Not After&rsquo; (Expiration)
date/time.</p>

<p><strong>Certificate Chain (Chain of Trust):</strong> An ordered list of certificates,
starting with an end-entity certificate, followed by one or more intermediate
certificates, and ending with a trusted root certificate. It allows a client to
verify that an end-entity certificate is trustworthy by tracing it back to a
root CA certificate stored in the client&rsquo;s trust store.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>End-entity Certificate (or Leaf Certificate):</strong> The certificate issued for a
specific server/domain.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate Certificate:</strong> A certificate issued by a Root CA or another
Intermediate CA, used to sign end-entity certificates. Using intermediates
avoids exposing the root private key frequently.</li>
<li><strong>Root Certificate:</strong> A self-signed certificate from a Root CA that forms the
basis of trust. These are pre-installed in operating systems and browsers in a
&lsquo;Trust Store&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Certificate Signing Request (CSR):</strong> A message sent from an applicant to a CA
to apply for a digital identity certificate. It contains the public key and
subject information (like CN and SANs) and is usually signed with the
applicant&rsquo;s corresponding private key.</p>

<p><strong>Wildcard Certificate:</strong> A certificate that can secure multiple subdomains of a
single base domain (e.g., <code>*.example.com</code> would cover <code>www.example.com</code>,
<code>api.example.com</code>, etc., but not <code>example.com</code> itself or <code>sub.sub.example.com</code>).
Usually specified using a SAN entry like <code>*.example.com</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Signed Certificate:</strong> A certificate signed with its own private key
instead of by a trusted CA. Browsers and clients will typically issue warnings
for these certificates as they cannot be automatically trusted. Useful for
testing or internal systems where trust is established manually.</p>

<p><strong>Certificate Revocation List (CRL):</strong> A list published by a CA containing
serial numbers of certificates that have been revoked (invalidated before their
expiration date). Clients may check CRLs to ensure a certificate is still valid.</p>

<p><strong>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):</strong> A protocol used to check the
revocation status of a certificate in real-time without needing to download
large CRLs. Clients query an OCSP responder (run by the CA) with the
certificate&rsquo;s serial number.</p>

<p><strong>OCSP Stapling:</strong> A performance enhancement for OCSP where the web server
periodically obtains a signed OCSP response from the CA and sends (&ldquo;staples&rdquo;) it
to the client during the TLS handshake, saving the client from making a separate
OCSP query.</p>

<h2 id="acme-protocol">ACME Protocol</h2>

<p><strong>ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment):</strong> A protocol for
automating the interactions between CAs and users&rsquo; web servers or clients,
enabling the automatic issuance, renewal, and revocation of TLS certificates.
Let&rsquo;s Encrypt is the most prominent user of ACME.</p>

<p><strong>ACME Client:</strong> Software that runs on a user&rsquo;s server or device and
communicates with an ACME server (CA) to request, renew, and manage certificates
according to the ACME protocol. Examples include Certbot, acme.sh, lego, etc.</p>

<p><strong>ACME Server:</strong> The endpoint provided by a CA that implements the ACME
protocol, allowing ACME clients to interact with it.</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt:</strong> A non-profit Certificate Authority that provides free X.509
certificates through the automated ACME protocol.</p>

<p><strong>Account Key:</strong> A cryptographic key pair used by an ACME client to sign its
requests to the ACME server, authenticating the client to its account with the
CA.</p>

<p><strong>Order:</strong> An ACME object representing a client&rsquo;s request for a certificate for
a set of identifiers (domain names).</p>

<p><strong>Authorization:</strong> An ACME object representing the CA&rsquo;s confirmation that an
account holder is authorized to manage a specific identifier (domain name). An
Order requires a valid Authorization for each identifier it contains.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A task given by the ACME server to the ACME client to prove
control over an identifier (domain name). Successfully completing a challenge is
necessary to get an Authorization. Common challenge types include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP-01:</strong> Prove control by provisioning a specific file with specific
content at a designated URL on the domain
(<code>http://&lt;domain&gt;/.well-known/acme-challenge/&lt;token&gt;</code>). Requires port 80 access.</li>
<li><strong>DNS-01:</strong> Prove control by provisioning a specific DNS TXT record under the
domain name being validated (<code>_acme-challenge.&lt;domain&gt;</code>). Requires API access to
DNS zone. Can be used for wildcard certificates.</li>
<li><strong>TLS-ALPN-01:</strong> Prove control using a special TLS certificate presented
during a TLS handshake using the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
extension. Requires control over the TLS server on port 443.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Identifier:</strong> A name (typically a DNS domain name) that a certificate request
pertains to. In ACME, these are the subjects for which authorization is sought.
Corresponds to SAN entries in the final certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Finalize Request:</strong> An ACME request sent by the client after fulfilling
authorizations. The client provides a CSR, and if valid, the ACME server issues
the certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Certificate Issuance:</strong> The final step where the ACME server, after successful
finalization, provides the issued certificate (and often the intermediate chain)
to the ACME client.</p>

<h2 id="authorities-trust">Authorities &amp; Trust</h2>

<p><strong>Certificate Authority (CA):</strong> An entity trusted to issue, sign, and manage
digital certificates. CAs verify the identity of certificate applicants before
issuing certificates.</p>

<p><strong>Root CA:</strong> The top-level Certificate Authority in a trust hierarchy. Root CAs
issue certificates for Intermediate CAs. Their root certificates are self-signed
and embedded in trust stores.</p>

<p><strong>Intermediate CA:</strong> A CA whose certificate is signed by a Root CA or another
Intermediate CA. They issue end-entity certificates, protecting the Root CA&rsquo;s
private key from frequent use.</p>

<p><strong>Public CA:</strong> A CA whose root certificates are included in the default trust
stores of major operating systems and browsers (e.g., Let&rsquo;s Encrypt, DigiCert,
GlobalSign). Certificates issued by Public CAs are generally trusted
automatically by clients.</p>

<p><strong>Private CA:</strong> A CA operated internally by an organization for issuing
certificates for internal use cases. Root certificates from Private CAs need to
be manually installed or distributed to client trust stores within the
organization.</p>

<p><strong>Trust Store:</strong> A collection of trusted Root CA certificates maintained by an
operating system, browser, or application. Certificates presented during a TLS
handshake are validated against this store via the certificate chain.</p>

<p><strong>Certificate Policy (CP):</strong> A document outlining the policies and procedures a
CA uses when issuing and managing certificates.</p>

<p><strong>Certification Practice Statement (CPS):</strong> A detailed document describing the
practices and procedures a CA employs to implement its Certificate Policy,
including identity verification, issuance, revocation, and key management.</p>
