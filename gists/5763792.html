    public function Talk() 
    {
        echo 'Talk';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A Bird can&rsquo;t necessarily &ldquo;talk&rdquo; so you&rsquo;d assume that a Parrot can&rsquo;t be substituted with a Bird. But this isn&rsquo;t the Liskov principle.</p>

<p>The point is a Parrot should act like a Bird in all ways, so that someone who has a plan for dealing with birds in general won&rsquo;t be surprised by a Parrot they run across.</p>

<p>If the Parrot happens to be able to talk as well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because their plan doesn&rsquo;t involve asking birds to talk.</p>

<p>For example, perhaps they just call $bird-&gt;fly() on every Bird they get - the ability of a Parrot to talk won&rsquo;t disrupt that activity, so their algorithm still works. But if you invent a sort of bird that can&rsquo;t fly (an Ostrich, say), then you&rsquo;ve violated the principle, and their general bird-handling algorithm no longer works on all sorts of birds.</p>
