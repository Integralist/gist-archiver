<h2 id="vacancy-md">vacancy.md</h2>

<p>We are looking for a full-time web developer to join our expanding digital media team.</p>

<p>The candidate needs to be enthusiastic, proactive and passionate about programming. And, as well as having a killer set of skills already, you will need to want to learn new talents, understand the latest web development technologies and get to grips with the latest programming languages.</p>

<p>Although much of the work will be ‘backroom’, there will also be times when you will need to liaise directly with clients – in person, over the phone and by email – to help them with issues directly, so outstanding communication skills are also a must.</p>

<p>Finally, as part of our growing team, you will need to work well with other people, as well as take responsibility for your own work within specific projects.</p>

<hr />

<p>We need someone who is highly skilled in the following areas:</p>

<p>Back-end:</p>

<ul>
<li>MVC/Object-Oriented PHP (v.5+)</li>
<li>Capable of developing complex data driven systems (without the aid of a framework! We don&rsquo;t shy away from using frameworks, but we understand the benefits of when and where to use them, and you should too!)</li>
<li>Capable of developing secure (SSL) e-commerce systems that plug into different payment systems (such as Barclays, WorldPay etc)</li>
<li>Adaptive thinker/problem solver (if you&rsquo;ve not encountered a particular request before then you need to be able to research and find a solution quickly)</li>
<li>Unit-Test your code (we know this is a pain, but the benefits far outweigh the negatives)</li>
<li>Version Control (we use the Git Version Control system)</li>
</ul>

<p>Front-end:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Solid JavaScript knowledge is essential. As modern web applications are now starting to blur the boundaries of what can be achieved and making applications feel more &lsquo;desktop like&rsquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>e.g. Ajax, DOM manipulation, cross browser implementations etc, ideally without a framework!</p>

<p>Not using a framework would be ideal as it&rsquo;ll demonstrate you understand the actual language itself.</p>

<p>But we have been known to use jQuery on some projects too.</p>

<p>You should be able to determine when it&rsquo;s best to use a framework and when not to, and we expect as part of your skills to know the pitfalls/best practices of the library.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Database:</p>

<ul>
<li>MySQL (v.5+)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>In addition, the following technical skills are not required but would be to the successful candidate’s advantage::</p>

<ul>
<li>Knowledge of Design Patterns and when best to use them.</li>
<li>Understanding of (or better yet direct experience) how to architect a system to be scalable for high load usage</li>
<li>Understanding of (or skills to implement existing/develop own) push notification system</li>
<li>Server performance considerations (e.g. in case we need you to investigate performance issues potentially related to your code before hassling server engineers)</li>
<li>Regular Expressions</li>
<li>HTML5 (this is a bit of a &lsquo;loaded&rsquo; term, which means more than what HTML5 strictly covers - such as SVG, CSS 3, CORS, Geolocation etc - but your passion for technology will mean you are aware of these intricacies)</li>
<li>iOS app development (native Android app development would be interesting too)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Responsibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>Report any issues (technical or otherwise) to your line manager</li>
<li>All projects should have a technical specification of functionality written up for client approval before development begins - which you will handle.</li>
<li>Pro actively discuss new ideas and techniques with your colleagues (being passionate about technology you&rsquo;ll be excited to share what you&rsquo;ve learnt)</li>
<li>Be understanding. Sometimes a client can make a poor judgement/decision. We will always advise our clients of our recommended solution, but if the client chooses to ignore our advice then so be it - accept it and move on.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Salary is negotiable depending on what skills you have and the skills you&rsquo;re missing. But don&rsquo;t worry if you feel like you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;tick all the boxes&rdquo;, you may have enough for us to find a place for you in our team!</p>

<p>Interested? If you think you have the right skills and you’d like to apply for this role, simply send your CV to xxxxx</p>
