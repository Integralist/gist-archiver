<blockquote>
<p>The <code>ignore_changes</code> feature is intended to be used when a resource is created with references to data that may change in the future, but should not affect said resource after its creation. &ndash; <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes" target="_blank">Documentation</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pattern is: I want to ensure that this service has a dictionary called &ldquo;foo&rdquo; with a key &ldquo;bar&rdquo; with an intial value of &ldquo;baz&rdquo;, but after that I will managed the key/values externally.</p>

<p>This means you can&rsquo;t go back and add, edit or delete the data added as part of the HCL. That data will forever exist. New data will be expected to be &lsquo;managed&rsquo; (i.e. added, edited, deleted) <em>outside</em> of Terraform.</p>
