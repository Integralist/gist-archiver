<p>For something relatively simple like modifying a single record to a domain, it might feel like overkill to have a “plan” or “strategy” – but given the very public severity of screwing up DNS some caution is warranted. It’s like the old saying: “A packet of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”</p>

<p>There’s a simple way to limit your mistakes: never update both a DNS record and a TTL for that record at the same time. Ideally you’ll have a process of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drop TTL on the DNS record to something very low a couple of days before you actually need to make the switch. Ex: 300 seconds</li>
<li>Change the actual record on your cutover date.</li>
<li>Several days after you’ve made the switch, up the TTL to something higher.</li>
</ul>
