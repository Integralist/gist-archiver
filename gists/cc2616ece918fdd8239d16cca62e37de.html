# Author:  Eric Gebhart
#
# Purpose:  To be called by mutt as indicated by .mailcap to handle mail attachments.
#
# Function: Copy the given file to a temporary directory so mutt
#           Won't delete it before it is read by the application.
#
#           Along the way, discern the file type or use the type
#           That is given.
#
#           Finally use 'open' or 'open -a' if the third argument is
#           given.
#
#
# Arguments:
#
#     $1 is the file
#     $2 is the type - for those times when file magic isn't enough.
#                      I frequently get html mail that has no extension
#                      and file can't figure out what it is.
#
#                      Set to '-' if you don't want the type to be discerned.
#                      Many applications can sniff out the type on their own.
#                      And they do a better job of it too.
#
#                      Open Office and MS Office for example.
#
#     $3 is open with.  as in open -a 'open with this .app' foo.xls
#
# Examples:  These are typical .mailcap entries which use this program.
