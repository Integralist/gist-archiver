<h2 id="security-zero-trust-platform-md">Security. Zero Trust Platform.md</h2>

<p>A zero trust platform means that (in theory), we&rsquo;d be able to run malicious code <em>inside</em> our platform with no risk â€“ the code wouldn&rsquo;t be able to interact with anything dangerous without being granted special access by the platform&rsquo;s own security/infrastructure team.</p>

<p>The idea is that we don&rsquo;t want to trust just anything simply because it&rsquo;s inside our platform. Instead, we want individual services to be trusted based on a short and deliberate list of which other services they&rsquo;re allowed to interact with. This makes an attack substantially more difficult.</p>
