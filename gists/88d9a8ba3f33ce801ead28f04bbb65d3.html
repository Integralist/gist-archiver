<h2 id="fakes">Fakes</h2>

<p>Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (e.g. a working version of a datastore that has a get and set method but writes to local disk rather than actually writing to a database).</p>

<h2 id="stubs">Stubs</h2>

<p>Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what&rsquo;s programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it &lsquo;sent&rsquo;, or maybe only how many messages it &lsquo;sent&rsquo;.</p>

<h2 id="mocks">Mocks</h2>

<p>Mocks are what we are talking about here: objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.</p>

<p>Additionally, mocks are seen as a thing that we will assert validations against. They have the responsiblity of recording how it was, or wasn&rsquo;t, used (e.g. &ldquo;assert that an API were called with xyz values&rdquo;, &ldquo;assert that an endpoint was not called&rdquo;, etc).</p>
