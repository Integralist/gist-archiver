<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get the domain <code>www.markandcat.co.uk</code> pointing to the repository: <a href="http://integralist.github.com/Mark-and-Cat/" target="_blank">http://integralist.github.com/Mark-and-Cat/</a></p>

<p>Looking at the help pages on GitHub the first thing it says to do is to upload a <code>CNAME</code> file with your domain name (in this case <code>markandcat.co.uk</code>) and this I&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<p>The next step apparently is to set-up a CNAME record via your domain registrar (in this case <code>123-reg</code>) and looking at 123-reg&rsquo;s DNS page (<a href="http://cl.ly/321S0S41121S200f0l1T" target="_blank">http://cl.ly/321S0S41121S200f0l1T</a>) what would I need to set and where? As I assumed that I would need to first set the A record &lsquo;www&rsquo; hostname to point to the Github ip (which as you can see I&rsquo;ve done) and since then - as you can see in the attached image - I&rsquo;ve added a CNAME record with its hostname set to <code>www</code> and it&rsquo;s value set to <code>integralist.github.com.</code> (the value was forced by 123-reg as <code>integralist.github.com/Mark-and-Cat/</code> was invalid) - so I&rsquo;m not sure how GitHub knows what repo to point the domain to (I&rsquo;m assuming it will try and sent the domain to the repo integralist.github.com)?</p>
