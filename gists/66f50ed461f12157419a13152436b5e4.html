<pre><code class="language-markdown">Distributed Tracing is the process of tracking and analyzing what happens to a request (transaction) across all services it touches.

- **Transaction**: request
- **Trace ID**: unique request identifier
- **Trace**: entire transaction (across all services)
- **Span**: logical chunk of work in a given 'Trace'

Spans have parent-child relationships. A parent can have multiple children. The first span is the &quot;root span&quot;. Each span has an ID and a pointer to its parent span ID.
