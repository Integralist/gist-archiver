<h2 id="3-refactoring-notes-md">3. Refactoring - Notes.md</h2>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">I refactored this code by making just a couple of very basic tweaks...

1. move all logic out of the conditional and into variables
2. removed unnecessary syntax cruft from `isProxyBrowser`
3. give the variables descriptive names
4. further break down the logic (e.g. group the checks for 'cutting the mustard' and 'being a proxy based browser')
5. reversed the `isProxyBased` logic so it becomes `isNotProxyBased` (this meant we didn't clutter `modernDevice` with extra syntax and made it as readable as possible)
6. use selected variables within the conditional

<pre><code class="language-markdown">Is there any thing more we could do with this code to make it as simple as possible to understand?

Well, one small tweak we *could* make would be to simplify the conditional even further. We could do this by creating another variable (again with a helpfully descriptive identifier) to hold the check of `modernDevice || holepunched`, like so...

```js
var cutsTheMustard = 'querySelector' in document &amp;&amp; 'localStorage' in window &amp;&amp; 'addEventListener' in window,
    isNotProxyBased = !/S40[\w]{3,5}Browser|Opera\sMini\//i.test(navigator.userAgent),
    modernDevice = cutsTheMustard &amp;&amp; isNotProxyBased,
    holepunched = isIE &gt; 6 &amp;&amp; document.getElementById('js-holepunched'),
    enhancedExperience = modernDevice || holepunched;
 
if (enhancedExperience) {
    // do stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>One thing to be aware of is: refactoring can actually be a bad thing if you don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re doing it. If you&rsquo;re just blindly following predefined rules of refactoring then the above small tweak could end up making the code harder to read.</p>

<p>Imagine if we were in a situation where there wasn&rsquo;t a logical association between <code>modernDevice</code> and <code>holepunched</code>. We could end up creating a variable like <code>passesOurChecks</code> (this is a poor example I know). Which would mean this new variable would actually make the code slightly harder to read because it wouldn&rsquo;t be descriptive enough and would likely mean the reader would need to check what the value of that variable was to better understand the code.</p>

<p>Just something to keep in mind.</p>

## 1. Refactoring - Original.js

```javascript
var isProxyBased = (/S40[\w]{3,5}Browser|Opera\sMini\//i).test(navigator.userAgent);

if (('querySelector' in document &amp;&amp; 'localStorage' in window &amp;&amp; 'addEventListener' in window &amp;&amp; !isProxyBased) || (isIE &gt; 6 &amp;&amp; document.getElementById('js-holepunched'))) {
    // do stuff
}
