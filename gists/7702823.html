<p>I refactored this code by making just a couple of very basic tweaks&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>move all logic out of the conditional and into variables</li>
<li>removed unnecessary syntax cruft from <code>isProxyBrowser</code></li>
<li>give the variables descriptive names</li>
<li>further break down the logic (e.g. group the checks for &lsquo;cutting the mustard&rsquo; and &lsquo;being a proxy based browser&rsquo;)</li>
<li>reversed the <code>isProxyBased</code> logic so it becomes <code>isNotProxyBased</code> (this meant we didn&rsquo;t clutter <code>modernDevice</code> with extra syntax and made it as readable as possible)</li>
<li>use selected variables within the conditional</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there any thing more we could do with this code to make it as simple as possible to understand?</p>

<p>Well, one small tweak we <em>could</em> make would be to simplify the conditional even further. We could do this by creating another variable (again with a helpfully descriptive identifier) to hold the check of <code>modernDevice || holepunched</code>, like so&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">var cutsTheMustard = 'querySelector' in document &amp;&amp; 'localStorage' in window &amp;&amp; 'addEventListener' in window,
    isNotProxyBased = !/S40[\w]{3,5}Browser|Opera\sMini\//i.test(navigator.userAgent),
    modernDevice = cutsTheMustard &amp;&amp; isNotProxyBased,
    holepunched = isIE &gt; 6 &amp;&amp; document.getElementById('js-holepunched'),
    enhancedExperience = modernDevice || holepunched;
 
if (enhancedExperience) {
    // do stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>One thing to be aware of is: refactoring can actually be a bad thing if you don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re doing it. If you&rsquo;re just blindly following predefined rules of refactoring then the above small tweak could end up making the code harder to read.</p>

<p>Imagine if we were in a situation where there wasn&rsquo;t a logical association between <code>modernDevice</code> and <code>holepunched</code>. We could end up creating a variable like <code>passesOurChecks</code> (this is a poor example I know). Which would mean this new variable would actually make the code slightly harder to read because it wouldn&rsquo;t be descriptive enough and would likely mean the reader would need to check what the value of that variable was to better understand the code.</p>

<p>Just something to keep in mind.</p>
