<h2 id="approaches">Approaches</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Regex Table</strong>: loop through pre-compiled regexes and pass matches using the request context.</li>
<li><strong>Regex Switch</strong>: a switch statement with cases that call a regex-based match() helper which scans path parameters into variables.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern Matcher</strong>: similar to the above, but using a simple pattern matching function instead of regexes.</li>
<li><strong>Split Switch</strong>: split the path on / and then switch on the contents of the path segments.</li>
<li><strong>ShiftPath</strong>: Axel Wagner’s hierarchical ShiftPath technique.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>In this comparison we&rsquo;re not concerned about speed. Most of the approaches loop or switch through a list of routes (in contrast to fancy trie-lookup structures). All of these approaches only add a few microseconds to the request time, and that isn&rsquo;t an issue in the majority of web applications.</p>

<h2 id="opinions">Opinions</h2>

<p>Below are the opinions of the author of the article (linked above), while my (@integralist) own preference is towards &ldquo;Regex Switch&rdquo; due to the ease of implementation and the ease of understanding for engineers working on the code, as well as the extra flexibility you get over the &ldquo;Regex Table&rdquo; approach.</p>

<h3 id="regex-table">Regex Table</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#regex-table" target="_blank">https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#regex-table</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/retable/route.go" target="_blank">https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/retable/route.go</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s basically a table of pre-compiled regexp objects with a little 21-line routing function that loops through them, and calls the first one that matches both the path and the HTTP method.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing particularly clever about the regex table approach, and it&rsquo;s similar to how a number of the third-party packages work. But it&rsquo;s so simple it only takes a few lines of code and a few minutes to write. It&rsquo;s also easy to modify if you need to: for example, to add logging, change the error responses to JSON, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="regex-switch">Regex Switch</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#regex-switch" target="_blank">https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#regex-switch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/reswitch/route.go" target="_blank">https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/reswitch/route.go</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The second approach still uses regexes, but with a simple imperative switch statement and a <code>match()</code> helper to go through the matches. The advantage of this approach is that you can call other functions or test other things in each case. Also, the signature of the <code>match</code> function allows you to &ldquo;scan&rdquo; path parameters into variables in order to pass them to the handlers more directly.</p>

<p>I must admit to being quite fond of this approach. I like how simple and direct it is, and I think the scan-like behaviour for path parameters is clean. Overall, despite liking the clarity of this approach and the scan-like <code>match()</code> helper, a point against it is the messiness required to cache the regex compilation.</p>

<h3 id="pattern-matcher">Pattern Matcher</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#pattern-matcher" target="_blank">https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#pattern-matcher</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/pat/route.go" target="_blank">https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/pat/route.go</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This approach is similar to the regex switch method, but instead of regexes it uses a simple, custom pattern matcher.</p>

<p>The patterns supplied to the custom <code>match()</code> function handle one wildcard character, <code>+</code>, which matches (and captures) any characters till the next <code>/</code> in the request path. This is of course much less powerful than regex matching, but generally I&rsquo;ve not needed anything more than &ldquo;match till next slash&rdquo; in my routes.</p>

<p>I quite like this approach (and it&rsquo;s efficient), but the byte-by-byte matching code was a little fiddly to write – definitely not as simple as calling <code>regex.FindStringSubmatch()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="split-switch">Split Switch</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#split-switch" target="_blank">https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#split-switch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/split/route.go" target="_blank">https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/split/route.go</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This approach simply splits the request path on <code>/</code> and then uses a switch with case statements that compare the number of path segments and the content of each segment. It&rsquo;s direct and simple, but also a bit error-prone, with lots of hard-coded lengths and indexes.</p>

<p>So while I like the bare-bones simplicity of this approach – just basic string equality comparisons – the verbosity of the matching and the error-prone integer constants would make me think twice about actually using it for anything but very simple routing.</p>

<h3 id="shiftpath">ShiftPath</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#shiftpath" target="_blank">https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/#shiftpath</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/shiftpath/route.go" target="_blank">https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/shiftpath/route.go</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A technique involving a small <code>ShiftPath()</code> helper that returns the first path segment, and shifts the rest of the URL down. The current handler switches on the first path segment, then delegates to sub-handlers which do the same thing on the rest of the URL.</p>

<p>While I like the idea of just using the standard library, and the path-shifting technique is quite clever, I strongly prefer seeing my URLs all in one place – This approach spreads the logic across many handlers, so it&rsquo;s difficult to see what handles what. It&rsquo;s also quite a lot of code, some of which is error prone.</p>

<p>On balance, I find it too verbose and think it&rsquo;d be difficult for people reading the code to quickly answer the question, &ldquo;given this HTTP method and URL, what happens?&rdquo;</p>
