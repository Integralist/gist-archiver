<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Raise

&gt; Use `raise` instead of `fail` to *rethrow* exceptions

This means if you catch an error that's been thrown by an external gem/library then you can choose to re-throw it as a different exception (i.e. your own Exception error, named specifically relevant to your application)

## Fail

&gt; Use `fail` instead of `raise` to *signal* exceptions

This means if you catch an error that's been thrown by your own code (e.g. you've raised a custom error/exception), then this means you don't intend to re-throw the exception as something else, you'll instead deal with that exact exception now
