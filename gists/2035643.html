<pre><code class="language-markdown">If you have a photo that is 1600 x 1200 pixels, but your website only has space for a photo 400 pixels wide. To find the new height of your photo — while preserving the aspect ratio — you would need to do the following calculation:

`original height / original width x new width = new height`

`1200 / 1600 x 400 = 300`
