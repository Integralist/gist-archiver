<ul>
<li>ü§î Understand the requirements, and specifically why they are important.</li>
<li>üìù Create simple/high-level Gherkin <a href="#user-stories">user stories</a> to help understand the product values and standards.</li>
<li>‚úÖ Break down the requirements into milestones and manageable sub tasks

<ul>
<li>inc. investigation time, QA (Quality Assurance) and security testing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>üîù Prioritise tasks

<ul>
<li>e.g. either by &lsquo;importance/impact&rsquo; (High, Medium, Low) or using &lsquo;MSC&rsquo; (Must Should Could)</li>
<li>Once categorized, group related items (e.g. group together all high, medium, low items)</li>
<li>A table matrix can help visualise the various tasks and their importance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>üóí Work through the unknowns until you really feel that there is no more value to be gained in spending time on them.</li>
<li>üó£ Figure out who and which teams need to be consulted, and communicate as often as practical.</li>
<li>üìÜ Run the project and adjust the plan as you go.

<ul>
<li>How far has the project has come?</li>
<li>How far is it from completion?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>üìà Track changes to requirements and be clear about the cost of those changes

<ul>
<li>How do they affect the completion?</li>
<li>Should we cut some existing features in order to accommodate the new work?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>üìä Ensure observability and monitoring is in place.</li>
<li>‚õë Define a rollout plan and what the roll back steps look like.

<ul>
<li>What systems need to be integrated with?</li>
<li>Notify appropriate on-call and support teams</li>
</ul></li>
<li>‚ù§Ô∏è Retro

<ul>
<li>What went well, what didn&rsquo;t, what could we do differently in future?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>üéâ CELEBRATE!</li>

<h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Gherkin is plain-text with a little extra structure and is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, yet structured enough to allow concise description of examples to illustrate business rules in most real-world domains. &ndash; <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/reference" target="_blank">https://cucumber.io/docs/reference</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s good for documentation and it can be helpful to some teams to use these user stories as a foundation for their own integration testing systems (although I personally wouldn&rsquo;t, I prefer just using them as a simple reference for what it is we want to achieve at a high-level).</p>

<pre><code class="language-cucumber">Feature: User Authentication
  
  ...optional description about this feature here...

Scenario: authenticated user requesting a page
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I‚Äôm already signed in
  When I visit www.buzzfeed.com or www.buzzfeed.com/post
  Then I am directed to my destination page

Scenario: unauthenticated user requesting a page
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I‚Äôm not signed in
  When I visit www.buzzfeed.com or www.buzzfeed.com/post
  Then I am able to login with &lt;method&gt;

  Examples:
    | method            |
    | Facebook          |
    | Twitter           |
    | Google            |
    | Username/Password |

Scenario: unauthenticated user successful login
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I provide valid credentials
  When I attempt to login
  Then I am directed to my destination page

Scenario: unauthenticated user failed login
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I provide invalid credentials
  When I attempt to login
  Then I am presented with a login error

Scenario: unauthenticated user sign-up
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I am not already registered in the system
  When I visit www.buzzfeed.com/cms
  Then I am directed to a legacy sign-up flow

<h2 id="positive-mindset">Positive Mindset</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that swapping the word &ldquo;problem&rdquo; for &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; a good thing to do in general, whether it be talking about an actual technical challenge or discussing a challenging interaction with another employee. The subtle switch in language helps me refocus on a more positive and motivated projectory (rather than setting myself up to be in a negative mindset for the conversation).</p>

<h2 id="recognising-trends">Recognising Trends</h2>

<p>It can be useful, when reporting to your line manager (e.g. 1:1&rsquo;s where you discuss things that are on your mind), it can be difficult sometimes to voice concerns without explicit examples.</p>

<p>Depending on the situation, explicit examples aren&rsquo;t always possible to recall. In those cases where you have a niggling feeling something isn&rsquo;t quite right but you couldn&rsquo;t point to an exact point in time where an incident occurred, then being able to see a <em>trend</em> of something negative happening can help you to raise it up to leadership.</p>

<p>Be aware of trends in people, otherwise you might find yourself in a bad situation and not sure how or why you got there in the first place. Not everything is so &lsquo;black and white&rsquo; and obvious.</p>
