## What Who How Why?

- **Product Manager**: owns the story of &quot;what&quot;
- **Engineering Manager**: owns the story of &quot;who&quot;
- **Engineering Lead (Tech Lead)**: owns the story of &quot;how&quot;
- **All Three**: each person shares ownership of the story of &quot;why&quot;

## Project Management

- ü§î Understand the requirements, and specifically why they are important. 
- üìù Create simple/high-level Gherkin [user stories](#user-stories) to help understand the product values and standards. 
- ‚úÖ Break down the requirements into milestones and manageable sub tasks 
  - inc. investigation time, QA (Quality Assurance) and security testing
- üîù Prioritise tasks
  - e.g. either by 'importance/impact' (High, Medium, Low) or using 'MSC' (Must Should Could)
  - Once categorized, group related items (e.g. group together all high, medium, low items)
  - A table matrix can help visualise the various tasks and their importance
- üóí Work through the unknowns until you really feel that there is no more value to be gained in spending time on them.
- üó£ Figure out who and which teams need to be consulted, and communicate as often as practical.
- üìÜ Run the project and adjust the plan as you go. 
  - How far has the project has come? 
  - How far is it from completion?
- üìà Track changes to requirements and be clear about the cost of those changes
  - How do they affect the completion?
  - Should we cut some existing features in order to accommodate the new work? 
- üìä Ensure observability and monitoring is in place. 
- ‚õë Define a rollout plan and what the roll back steps look like. 
  - What systems need to be integrated with?
  - Notify appropriate on-call and support teams
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Retro 
  - What went well, what didn't, what could we do differently in future?
- üéâ CELEBRATE!

## User Stories

&gt; Gherkin is plain-text with a little extra structure and is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, yet structured enough to allow concise description of examples to illustrate business rules in most real-world domains. -- [https://cucumber.io/docs/reference](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference)

It's good for documentation and it can be helpful to some teams to use these user stories as a foundation for their own integration testing systems (although I personally wouldn't, I prefer just using them as a simple reference for what it is we want to achieve at a high-level).

```cucumber
Feature: User Authentication
  
  ...optional description about this feature here...

Scenario: authenticated user requesting a page
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I‚Äôm already signed in
  When I visit www.buzzfeed.com or www.buzzfeed.com/post
  Then I am directed to my destination page

Scenario: unauthenticated user requesting a page
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I‚Äôm not signed in
  When I visit www.buzzfeed.com or www.buzzfeed.com/post
  Then I am able to login with &lt;method&gt;

  Examples:
    | method            |
    | Facebook          |
    | Twitter           |
    | Google            |
    | Username/Password |

Scenario: unauthenticated user successful login
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I provide valid credentials
  When I attempt to login
  Then I am directed to my destination page

Scenario: unauthenticated user failed login
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I provide invalid credentials
  When I attempt to login
  Then I am presented with a login error

Scenario: unauthenticated user sign-up
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I am not already registered in the system
  When I visit www.buzzfeed.com/cms
  Then I am directed to a legacy sign-up flow

<h2 id="positive-mindset">Positive Mindset</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that swapping the word &ldquo;problem&rdquo; for &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; a good thing to do in general, whether it be talking about an actual technical challenge or discussing a challenging interaction with another employee. The subtle switch in language helps me refocus on a more positive and motivated projectory (rather than setting myself up to be in a negative mindset for the conversation).</p>

<h2 id="recognising-trends">Recognising Trends</h2>

<p>It can be useful, when reporting to your line manager (e.g. 1:1&rsquo;s where you discuss things that are on your mind), it can be difficult sometimes to voice concerns without explicit examples.</p>

<p>Depending on the situation, explicit examples aren&rsquo;t always possible to recall. In those cases where you have a niggling feeling something isn&rsquo;t quite right but you couldn&rsquo;t point to an exact point in time where an incident occurred, then being able to see a <em>trend</em> of something negative happening can help you to raise it up to leadership.</p>

<p>Be aware of trends in people, otherwise you might find yourself in a bad situation and not sure how or why you got there in the first place. Not everything is so &lsquo;black and white&rsquo; and obvious.
