<p>There are three types of documents you should write, in this specific order:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Project</strong> document</li>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> document</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong> document</li>
</ol>

<p>A &ldquo;project&rdquo; document is for planning the overarching/broader project work.<br />
It&rsquo;s responsible for breaking down the project into smaller milestones.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; document is for <em>discovering</em> how we&rsquo;ll solve ONE of the milestones defined in the project document.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;design&rdquo; document describes our design plan for what we&rsquo;re going to build from the discovery document.<br />
It will be presented to lead engineers (and architects) to review and approve.</p>

<h2 id="project-document">Project Document</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Preliminary Milestones:</strong> This describes significant ‘stages’ in the project&rsquo;s timeline and serves as markers of progress.</li>
<li><strong>Key Objectives:</strong> This describes the high-level outcomes that are desired.</li>
<li><strong>Current Architecture:</strong> Visualise the architecture at a high-level.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Architecture:</strong> Visualise the new architecture at a high-level.</li>
<li><strong>Design Benefits:</strong></li>
<li><strong>Functional Requirements:</strong> This defines the specific <em>behaviors</em>, <em>actions</em>, or <em>functions</em> that the software must perform.</li>
<li><strong>Non-functional Requirements:</strong> This describes the <em>characteristics</em> of the system (e.g. performance, security, reliability etc).</li>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> This section includes miscellaneous documents and links relevant to the overall discussion.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="discovery-document">Discovery Document</h2>

<p>This document presents an objective assessment of the existing system&rsquo;s requirements and deficiencies, and proposes a high-level approach that will inform the creation of a more detailed design document.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Glossary:</strong> Make sure everyone is on the same page as to what certain words mean.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Abstraction:</strong> What the customer perceives is happening. It’s what they buy/use/derive value from.</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> What is the current situation and what are the concerns?</li>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> What are the underlying problems contributing to this situation?</li>
<li><strong>Approach:</strong> What will be our approach to resolve these issues?</li>
<li><strong>Business Outcomes:</strong> The desired, measurable results of this project that directly benefit the business.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-document">Design Document</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong> What specifically are we trying to accomplish? By when? Are there guiding principles to follow?</li>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Include any technical (storage, accessibility, latency/speed, monitoring &amp; alerting), security, compliance or Product-requested deliverables.</li>
<li><strong>Out of Scope (Non-Goals):</strong> What are we thoughtfully and purposefully excluding from this project?</li>
<li><strong>Success metrics:</strong> How will we know when the project is done? Include any timelines to meet.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Design:</strong> How are we proposing to solve the problems: what are we doing, what systems will change?</li>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Why did we choose this approach? This should include a link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZnxIY4BCnsUaY65Cc2GCmzmq18XBJvG2iErSWfMjW10/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">a matrix spreadsheet</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Interactions with existing systems:</strong> What systems/components are available to build from or interact with? Are there relationships to common Fastly architecture principles?</li>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong> What resources do we need for this proposed design? Are there licenses, versions, hardware, specific expertise and training,etc to include?</li>
<li><strong>Development Stages:</strong> Identify the implementation stages of the project, so people understand what roll out looks like and how it will be approached.</li>
<li><strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> Describe other options considered and trade off/decisions for not doing.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations, Risks or Constraints:</strong> Add any special considerations, risks, or constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Open Questions:</strong> Note anything for further investigation or future problems to solve (create action items and assign for follow-up if needed).</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholders &amp; Approval:</strong> Primary stakeholders listed check the box to indicate sign-off or add comments with questions/concerns.</li>
<li><strong>References:</strong> Include any links to related documents: Problem Statement, PRD, POC proposals, boards or architecture documentation for additional context.</li>
</ul>
