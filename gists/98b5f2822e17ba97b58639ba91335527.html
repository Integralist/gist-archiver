# execute commands within the virtual environment (e.g. dev dependency ipython was installed)
poetry run ipython

# load virtual environment permanently for the current shell (e.g. now python version will be the expected environment, not the OS version)
poetry shell
python --version

# here is a shortened Python3 example, as the above uses the OS default of Python2 for installing `2.7.15`
# where as if you tried to set the Python version in the `pyproject.toml` to `^3.7` it would fail as that Python version wouldn't be available
# it means whenever you want to setup a new Python3 environment, you'll need a compatible Python interpreter running first.
# e.g. if you want to install 3.7.1 you'll need 3.7.3 running first to execute Poetry (this isn't necessary with Python2 as we already had 2.7 available by the OS)
pyenv install 3.7.3
pyenv local 3.7.3
