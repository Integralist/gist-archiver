&gt; Note:  
&gt; sequential == collection keeps order of population  
&gt; ordered == collection is re-ordered (implements a Sequence interface)

**Tuple**

- ordered
- duplicates allowed

**Set**

- sequential
- no duplicates

&gt; Note: Clojure's Set data structure appears to be ordered `#{3 1 2}`, `(first #{3 1 2})` returns 1

**Linked list**

- list contains nodes
- each node holds: 
  - data
  - pointer to the next node
- the last node's pointer points to `null` 
  - this is a singly linked list
  - a doubly linked list will also have a pointer to the previous node
- no direct access to individual elements
  - you must access the head and navigate until element is found

**Array/Vector**

- index access
- duplicates allowed
- Vectors are synchronised (i.e. thread-safe)
- Arrays allow operations across multiple threads (i.e. not thread-safe)
- Array size is determined up front
  - you cannot remove an element from an Array
    - but you can put a null pointer or no value to it
- Vector is dynamic (i.e. it can resize dynamically based on new elements added)
- Arrays can't add elements to a specific index, only to the end. 
- Vectors are like super Arrays.

**List/Sequence**

- ordered
- duplicates allowed (but finite size)

**Stack**

- ordered
- LIFO (last in, first out)
- only actions available are `push` and `pop` (`push` directs &quot;in&quot;, `pop` directs &quot;out&quot;)

**Queue**

- ordered
- FIFO (first in, first out)
- only actions available are `enqueue` and `dequeue` (`enqueue` directs &quot;in&quot;, `dequeue` directs &quot;out&quot;)
