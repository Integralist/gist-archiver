@coroutine
def validate(
    timestamp: float, expected: str, then_sleep: int = 0, fail: bool = False
):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;validate should confirm if responses are as expected.

    we use a map data structure (`m`) to translate the `then_sleep` value into
    a descriptive value for the purposes of debugging when a validation check
    fails.

    the `then_sleep` value indicates how long the program will 'sleep' for
    before continuing. this means the next batch of requests will be blocked
    for that period of time.

    for example, if `then_sleep` is set to 5, then this means we'll request the
    various pages and then we'll stop the program for five seconds. when the
    next batch of requests are made we should find that they yield cache HITs
    because the max-age of our cached objects are set to 10s.

    remember: in the CDN/VCL we are using a request header to control the
    caching directives and also whether we want the origin response to look
    like a failure or not...
