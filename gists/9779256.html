<p>This is my understanding of the difference between &ldquo;Concurrency&rdquo; and &ldquo;Parallelism&rdquo;. I believe it&rsquo;s <em>reasonably</em> accurate - although feel free to discuss in the comments if you feel the distinction is different to my definition.</p>

<p>Effectively there is just &ldquo;concurrency&rdquo;. Concurrency is the ability to handle multiple tasks/processes all running at the same time (rather than running tasks sequentially: one finishes, the next starts).</p>

<p>If there is only a single CPU available then concurrent processes won&rsquo;t perform as well as you might think because the CPU will be forced to do something called &ldquo;task switching&rdquo;. Imagine you have two tasks (A and B) which are running concurrently; &ldquo;task switching&rdquo; breaks down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>CPU works on task A for a short (predetermined) amount of time</li>
<li>If task A isn&rsquo;t complete by end of the set time frame then task B is started</li>
<li>CPU works on task B (again only for the predetermined amount of time)</li>
<li>If task B doesn&rsquo;t complete within the time frame then the CPU jumps back to work on task A</li>
<li>&hellip;and back and forth the single CPU goes until both task A and B are complete&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to improve &ldquo;task switching&rdquo; is to run tasks in parallel; but this requires multiple CPUs. Running tasks in parallel mean that both tasks A and B can genuinely run at the same time rather than one at a time (remember the default format of &ldquo;task switching&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t as slow as just running the task sequentially).</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s best to think of Concurrency as the <strong>goal</strong>; and &ldquo;task switching&rdquo; and &ldquo;parallelism&rdquo; as specific implementations; the latter yielding the fastest results.</p>
