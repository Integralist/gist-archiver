<pre><code class="language-markdown">This is my understanding of the difference between &quot;Concurrency&quot; and &quot;Parallelism&quot;. I believe it's *reasonably* accurate - although feel free to discuss in the comments if you feel the distinction is different to my definition.

Effectively there is just &quot;concurrency&quot;. Concurrency is the ability to handle multiple tasks/processes all running at the same time (rather than running tasks sequentially: one finishes, the next starts).

If there is only a single CPU available then concurrent processes won't perform as well as you might think because the CPU will be forced to do something called &quot;task switching&quot;. Imagine you have two tasks (A and B) which are running concurrently; &quot;task switching&quot; breaks down to:

- CPU works on task A for a short (predetermined) amount of time
- If task A isn't complete by end of the set time frame then task B is started
- CPU works on task B (again only for the predetermined amount of time)
- If task B doesn't complete within the time frame then the CPU jumps back to work on task A
- ...and back and forth the single CPU goes until both task A and B are complete...

One way to improve &quot;task switching&quot; is to run tasks in parallel; but this requires multiple CPUs. Running tasks in parallel mean that both tasks A and B can genuinely run at the same time rather than one at a time (remember the default format of &quot;task switching&quot; isn't as slow as just running the task sequentially).

So it's best to think of Concurrency as the **goal**; and &quot;task switching&quot; and &quot;parallelism&quot; as specific implementations; the latter yielding the fastest results.
