<pre><code class="language-shell"># UPDATE INTERFACE FILE
#
# The interface file contains all the API functions we expect to use from the
# go-fastly SDK. When adding a new command, we want to update this file to
# reflect any new API functions we're intending to use.
#
# I use Vim to handle the processing because it's easier for me (@integralist)
# to write the otherwise complex logic, compared to trying to use bash or some
# other tool such as Awk.
#
# STEPS:
# - We locate the Interface type.
# - Copy the last set of interface methods.
# - Capture line number for start of copied methods (to use in substitution).
# - Rename the API (three separate places per line).
#
# NOTE:
# Any backslash in the substitution commands (e.g. \v) need to be double escaped.
#   - Once because the backslash is inside the :exe command's expected string.
#   - And then again because of the parent HEREDOC container.
#
# CAVEATS:
# This isn't a perfect process. Its successfulness is based on whether the last
# set of commands align with our expectations. It will still produce ~95%
# expected output, but if there's an extra API function (e.g. BatchModify) then
# that line won't have the relevant API name replaced as we only look for the
# common CRUD methods (Create, Delete, Get, List, Update).

# The above takes advantage of multiple Vim features to workaround the fact that we're constrained primarily to using Ex commands to achieve this automation...
#
# 1. We can't use / to search for content, so I have to use :global along with :normal to get my cursor to where it needs to be.
# 
# 2. I don't know how many lines need to be copied, so I rely on Vim's notion of a &quot;paragraph&quot; i.e. `{` motion
#
# 3. Once I've copied the relevant text I need to get back to the original position my cursor was at. I would normally use &lt;Ctrl-o&gt; to go back once in Vim's jumplist, but there's no Ex mode equivalent command to achieve this and I also couldn't get :execute to work with &lt;Ctrl-o&gt; inside a :normal string expression. So I resorted to another Vim motion `]m` which luckily for my use case jumped me to the bottom of the code function I was in (which was where I needed to be). I could have just reused the :global trick but I wanted to avoid duplication of logic if possible and the motion was a quick win.
#
# 4. When using a substiution you can manually select the lines you want as a range, but with automation I don't know what the range should be (as it has to be programmatically determined) so this meant I needed to use some VimL. I start by using the `{` motion to get back to the top of the section of code I want to apply a substitution to and store the current line into a register using `setreg(...)` and `line('.')`. I then jump back to where I was before and I use `getreg(...)` to use as the start of my substitution range followed by `line('.')` as the end of the range. All of this is wrapped up with `:execute` and so we have to use the `&quot;,&quot;` string in-between to build up the range, and also put the substitution into a string.
#
# 5. As mentioned in the above NOTE I needed to double escape the backslashes used in the substitution. Which is a super pain.
