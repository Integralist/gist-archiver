<h2 id="oauth2">OAuth2</h2>

<p>OAuth is about &ldquo;authorization&rdquo; and not &ldquo;authentication&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="authentication-vs-authorization">Authentication vs Authorization</h3>

<ul>
<li>Authentication is the process of verification that an individual, entity or website is who it claims to be.</li>
<li>Authorization is the function of specifying access rights to resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there was only authentication, then we know <em>who</em> you are (and that you really are you and not someone pretending to be you), but we don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re allowed to access. e.g. a person enters an office building, but they might not be allowed to enter the IT computer room (without authorization the person can just walk into the IT computer room).</p>

<p>If there was only authorization, then we know <em>what</em> you can access, but we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s really you accessing the resource. e.g. a bad person stole an employee&rsquo;s key to get into the office&rsquo;s IT computer room but there was no security guard at the office&rsquo;s front door to check if the bad person was really the employee (i.e. really the owner of the key).</p>

<h3 id="resource-owner">Resource Owner</h3>

<p>If you have a jacket, then the jacket is the &ldquo;resource&rdquo; and you are the owner of that jacket (i.e. you are the &ldquo;resource owner&rdquo;).</p>

<h3 id="resource-server">Resource Server</h3>

<p>If you put your jacket into a locker, then the locker is the &ldquo;resource server&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="authorization-server">Authorization Server</h3>

<p>The locker is locked. The lock is the &ldquo;authorization server&rdquo; (the auth server ensures only you can access your jacket).</p>

<h3 id="client-application">Client/Application</h3>

<p>If you ask your friend to get your coat for you, then you&rsquo;re asking them to act on your behalf and so your friend is a &ldquo;client&rdquo; or &ldquo;application&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="access-token">Access Token</h3>

<p>An access token is something you present to the resource server to get access to your resource that is stored there.</p>

<p>There are different ways to &lsquo;implement&rsquo; an access token, such as a &ldquo;Bearer Token&rdquo;, &ldquo;JWT Token&rdquo;, &ldquo;Opaque Token&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Access tokens are typically short-lived and once expired you need to get a new access token to replace the expired one.</p>

<h3 id="refresh-token">Refresh Token</h3>

<p>A refresh token is a way to get more access tokens once they have expired.</p>

<h3 id="scopes">Scopes</h3>

<p>A scope is equivalent to a &ldquo;role&rdquo; or a &ldquo;permission&rdquo;. It indicates what can be accessed using the access token.</p>

<h3 id="grant-types">Grant Types</h3>

<p>There are different ways for a resource owner to acquire an access token (in order of how common they are):</p>

<ul>
<li>Client Credentials: Service-to-Service communication (simplest).</li>
<li>Authorization Code: Browser-based user login such as web, mobile, SPAs and CLIs (add PKCE for extra security, e.g. a public CLI code base which can&rsquo;t store secret data).</li>
<li>Device Code: Televisions and environments with limited input capabilities</li>
<li>Refresh: Obtain new tokens when one expires (works in tandem with the &ldquo;Authorization Code&rdquo; flow to help avoid having to do that full flow again when your token expires).</li>
<li>Password &amp; Implicit: Less secure option for CLI, mobile apps and SPAs (AVOID!).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="client-credentials">Client Credentials</h4>

<p>Client is trusted and contains an id and a secret which are used to acquire the token.</p>

<p>This is analogous to you losing your key for accessing your resource in the resource server and so a janitor (the client/app) uses its trusted id/secret to open the lock (the Authorization Server) to retrieve your jacket (the resource).</p>

<h4 id="password-avoid">Password (AVOID)</h4>

<p>This is very similar to Client Credentials, but highlights how insecure it is compared. Instead of having a client/app that is <em>trusted</em> you are giving your key to the lock directly to the client/app and they&rsquo;re opening the lock for you. Your key should only be held by you but now you&rsquo;ve given it away to someone else temporarily who might accidentally lose the key or hold onto it and do bad things with it in the future.</p>

<h4 id="authorization-code">Authorization Code</h4>

<p>This flow is &ldquo;browser based&rdquo; (making heavy use of HTTP redirects) making it a bit awkward for some devices like CLIs.</p>

<p>Most cases the user will be presented with a screen where they have to approve permissions being granted to the client/application.</p>

<p>It can be extended through the use of PKCE which means the client/application will <em>generate</em> a secret that is exchanged for an access token (still with permission approval screen).</p>

<p>This is analogous to you wanting to lend your jacket to your friend. Your friend goes to the locker and the lock (which is a very technically advanced lock) calls you to confirm it&rsquo;s OK for your friend to get access to your jacket. You enter your key (login) and confirm the access. Your friend is given a temporary key (auth code) and uses that to obtain a key (access token) to open the lock and gets the jacket.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The &ldquo;Implicit&rdquo; flow is very similar to the Authorization Code flow but there is no &ldquo;auth code&rdquo; given out, the client/app is just given the access token immediately. So &ldquo;Implicit&rdquo; is less secure because of this as the access token provided to the client/application could get intercepted along the way (unlike with the &ldquo;auth code&rdquo; addition in the Authorization Code flow).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="oidc">OIDC</h2>

<p>OpenID Connect is about &ldquo;identity&rdquo; (who you are, not what you can do).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an extension of OAuth2, so most of what we&rsquo;ve already seen is the same with OIDC.</p>

<p>OIDC has an Authorization Code flow like OAuth2 which doesn&rsquo;t provide an &ldquo;access token&rdquo; (like OAuth2) but an &ldquo;ID token&rdquo; which is used to login to something (typically used with SSO).</p>

<p>There is also a &ldquo;Hybrid&rdquo; flow which gives you <em>both</em> an ID token and an Access token.</p>

<p>This is analogous to you wanting to go to a swimming pool, but it&rsquo;s members only. Someone at the gate redirects you to the ticket booth (authorization server) and once you show your ID (i.e. login) you are given back a wrist band (i.e. an ID token) which can be used to enter the swimming pool.</p>
