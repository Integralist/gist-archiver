<h1 id="git-workflow-1">Git Workflow</h1>

<p>When using <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git Version Control</a> you have quite a few workflow variations. Which one you choose depends on your team and what fits your requirements and usage more appropriately.</p>

<p>Here are some popular options that will be described later in this document:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#1">Git &lsquo;Centralised&rsquo; Workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Git &lsquo;Feature Branches&rsquo; Workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Git &lsquo;Gitflow&rsquo; Workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Git &lsquo;Single Commit/No Branches&rsquo; Workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Git &lsquo;Rebase Feature Branch Commits&rsquo; Workflow</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>

<p>All of these workflows assume that you have a remote repository and by default the main branch is called <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>Also, we don&rsquo;t cover every possible detail about git and how it works/what certain concepts mean; as we assume a certain level of past experience from the reader. By this I mean, for example, if you don&rsquo;t know what a &lsquo;merge conflict&rsquo; is you&rsquo;ll need to read up on git a bit more first in order to benefit from this document.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-not-covered">What&rsquo;s not covered?</h2>

<p>One model I&rsquo;ve not covered is the &ldquo;Git &lsquo;Forked Repo&rsquo; Workflow&rdquo;, which is based around the concept of developers not having push access to a repository but are able to fork the repo (i.e. make a clone of it). Pull Requests can then be made to the upstream repository that was forked from.</p>

<p>The reason for not covering this particular workflow is that within the BBC the majority of repositories are private by nature (except for those specifically made to be open-source) and so all developers working on a specific project will be given push access to the relevant private repo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: although the BBC does not encourage forking of its own private repositories, it does recognise and accept that the forking model is the fundamental and primary concept behind the open-source movement</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="code-reviews">Code Reviews</h2>

<p>Although not directly related to git workflows, it&rsquo;s important to remember that the GitHub model of reviewing code revolves around the idea of a Pull Request, but this is merely a clever abstraction on top of gits own <code>git request-pull</code> model which is built around the simple concept that a feature should be encapsulated within a single commit.</p>

<p>The command <code>git request-pull</code> is described in the git manual as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summarizes the changes between two commits to the standard output, and includes the given URL in the generated summary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This facilitates the ability to post the diff/summary of changes into a mailing list for easy comparison and reasoning before consideration to merging into <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>The only requirement for using the built-in <code>git request-pull</code> is that you need to provide a URL for where the commit you&rsquo;re proposing to be reviewed/merged can be pulled from by the owner of the origin repo.</p>

<p>So in other words, you&rsquo;ll need to have a <em>fork</em> of the origin repo in another git repo that&rsquo;s accessible to the developers you&rsquo;re asking to review your commit. This isn&rsquo;t a problem for most organisations, although it&rsquo;s a little trickier for the BBC as it doesn&rsquo;t encourage forks of its private repositories. Just something to be aware of.</p>

<h2 id="git-centralised-workflow">Git &lsquo;Centralised&rsquo; Workflow</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary: everyone works from the <code>master</code> branch</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Everyone clones the remote repo and commits changes to <code>master</code> locally</li>
<li>Local changes are then pushed to the remote repository</li>
<li>If someone pushes changes before you, then your push will fail</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to pull their changes (<code>git pull origin master</code>) first</li>
<li>Any merge conflicts will then need to be resolved locally</li>
<li>Once merge conflicts are resolved, you can push to the remote</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can be less complex and time consuming than dealing with feature branches (assuming small teams of &amp;lt; 5)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Everyone committing to <code>master</code> can be uncomfortable for some teams</li>
<li>No categorised history, just multiple isolated commits</li>
<li>Merge commits are ugly and make the git history harder to reason about</li>
</ul>

<p><div id="2"></div></p>

<h2 id="git-feature-branches-workflow">Git &lsquo;Feature Branches&rsquo; Workflow</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary: everyone works from their own &lsquo;feature&rsquo; branch</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Everyone clones the remote repo and creates a feature branch</li>
<li>For example <code>git checkout -b feat/add-redis-cache</code></li>
<li>Commits are made to the feature branch locally</li>
<li>The feature branch should be pushed to the remote regularly</li>
<li>Feature branch is reviewed by other developers</li>
<li>Once approved the feature branch is merged into <code>master</code> locally</li>
<li>The updated <code>master</code> branch is then pushed to the remote</li>
<li>If someone pushes changes before you to <code>master</code>, then your push will fail</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to pull their changes (<code>git pull origin master</code>) first</li>
<li>Any merge conflicts will then need to be resolved locally</li>
<li>Once merge conflicts are resolved, you can push to the remote</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>To reduce the likeliness of a merge conflict, developers should consider updating their <code>master</code> branch regularly and merging those changes into their feature branch (e.g. <code>git merge master</code>).</p>

<p>Developers can also consider pulling <code>master</code> directly into their feature branch either by using <code>git pull origin master</code> or by using <code>git pull --rebase origin master</code> (which will unshift their feature branch commits so that they sit ontop of whatever is inside <code>master</code>; meaning the feature branch commits are &lsquo;top of the stack&rsquo;).</p>

<p>Also, when using <code>--rebase</code> you do typically experience less conflicts.</p>

<h3 id="pros-1">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Most recognised/utilised workflow model</li>
<li>Use of &lsquo;short lived&rsquo; feature branches allow decoupled development</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons-1">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>No clean history, just multiple isolated commits</li>
<li>Merge commits are ugly and make the git history harder to reason about †</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>† this is dependant on your team and your specific workflow<br />

<h2 id="git-gitflow-workflow">Git &lsquo;Gitflow&rsquo; Workflow</h2>

<p>Gitflow is an evolution of the &lsquo;feature branch&rsquo; model that adds additional layers to the workflow.</p>

<p>With Gitflow you have additional branches that interact with each other in different ways:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/05.svg" alt="Gitflow" /></p>

<ul>
<li><code>master</code>: always deployable to production (<code>git tag</code> with release info)</li>
<li><code>hotfix</code>: only branch to fork from <code>master</code> (for <em>quick</em> patches to production)</li>
<li><code>develop</code>: becomes the default branch for all development work</li>
<li><code>release</code>: forked off of <code>develop</code> once enough &lsquo;features&rsquo; are ready (only hotfixes to this branch until merge with <code>master</code>)</li>
<li><code>feature</code>: multiple feature branches that are merged back into <code>develop</code> when ready</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pros-2">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Provides a robust framework for dealing with large codebases</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons-2">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Vastly more complex</li>
<li>Multiple moving parts require solid co-ordination</li>
<li>No clean history, just multiple isolated commits</li>
</ul>

<p><div id="4"></div></p>

<h2 id="git-single-commit-no-branches-workflow">Git &lsquo;Single Commit/No Branches&rsquo; Workflow</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary: everyone works from <code>master</code>, but &lsquo;rebase&rsquo; commits before push</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Everyone clones the remote repo and commits changes to <code>master</code> locally</li>
<li>Local changes are rebased interactively (<code>git rebase -i &lt;commit&gt;</code>) into single commit</li>
<li>Local changes are then pushed to the remote repository</li>
<li>If someone pushes changes before you, then your push will fail</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to pull their changes (<code>git pull origin master</code>) first</li>
<li>Any merge conflicts will then need to be resolved locally</li>
<li>Once merge conflicts are resolved, you can push to the remote</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notes-1">Notes</h3>

<p>The reason you would choose this model is if you were using a traditional <code>git request-pull</code> for code reviews, and also it helps to keep your commit history clean and organised.</p>

<p>This approach ideally benefits small changes and short-lived PRs.</p>

<h3 id="pros-3">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can be less complex and time consuming than dealing with feature branches (assuming small teams of &amp;lt; 5)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons-3">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Requires a team comfortable with quick and small feature releases</li>
<li>Requires steps that are more complicated for beginner git users (e.g. interactive rebasing)</li>
<li>Prone to errors on teams larger than 4 people</li>
<li>Unable to work on more than one feature at a time</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="git-rebase-feature-branch-commits-workflow">Git &lsquo;Rebase Feature Branch Commits&rsquo; Workflow</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary: work from a &lsquo;feature&rsquo; branch, but &lsquo;rebase&rsquo; commits before merge</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Everyone clones the remote repo and creates a feature branch</li>
<li>For example <code>git checkout -b feat/add-redis-cache</code></li>
<li>Commits are made to the feature branch locally</li>
<li>The feature branch should be pushed to the remote regularly</li>
<li>Feature branch is reviewed by other developers</li>
<li>Once approved the feature branch commits are rebased (<code>git rebase -i master</code>) into single commit</li>
<li>Commit message has specific format (<code>Closes #1 - Add Redis Cache (Fixes #2)</code>)</li>
<li>Commit is then cherry-picked into <code>master</code> (<code>git cherry-pick -</code>)</li>
<li>The updated <code>master</code> branch is then pushed to the remote</li>
<li>If someone pushes changes before you to <code>master</code>, then your push will fail</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to pull their changes (<code>git pull --rebase origin master</code>) first</li>
<li>Any merge conflicts will then need to be resolved locally</li>
<li>Once merge conflicts are resolved, you can push to the remote</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notes-2">Notes</h3>

<p>GitHub specifically offers a feature where by GitHub issues are automatically closed whenever a push to <code>master</code> includes the phrase <code>Fixes #n</code> (where <code>n</code> is the issue number); similarly it&rsquo;ll automatically close a pull request when the commit message in <code>master</code> includes the phrase <code>Closes #n</code> (where <code>n</code> is the pull request number).</p>

<p>Also, the GitHub user interface now (as of 2016) suppports the ability to squash commits when merging. This might be a preferable option to the above steps.</p>

<h3 id="pros-4">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use of &lsquo;short lived&rsquo; feature branches allow decoupled development</li>
<li>Clean git commit history (no ugly merge commits †)</li>
<li>Auto closing of Pull Requests and Issues within GitHub (assuming relevant commit syntax is used ^^)</li>
<li>Access to original commit history within GitHub Pull Request interface</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>† this is dependant on your team and your specific workflow<br />
and the details a merge commit provides</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="cons-4">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>If a feature branch takes too long to merge, it can become a conflict nightmare</li>
<li>Requires steps that are more complicated for beginner git users (e.g. interactive rebasing and cherry picking)</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t access original commit history via a terminal shell</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: if branches are deleted from GitHub then eventually the commits will be garbage collected and history lost there as well. So pick this option according to whether it fits your team&rsquo;s long term needs</p>
