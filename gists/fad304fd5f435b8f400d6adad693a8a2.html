<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
Even though you can call the pointer receiver method, you still can&rsquo;t access a field without triggering a runtime panic. But just being able to call the method is still useful/interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The explanation for this is as follows&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>There’s two things going on here. The first is calling a method. Go knows which method to call thanks to the name of the method and the type of the receiver. That’s all there is to knowing which method to call.</p>

<p>e.g. The Go runtime evaluates the code <code>e.PointerMethod()</code> into something like <code>(*Example).PointerMethod(e)</code>.</p>

<p>The trick to understand the rest is to remember that having a pointer be nil is not a reason to panic just yet. You only panic when you try to do something that needs to dereference that nil pointer.</p>

<p>Now when the method gets called, the sugared version (e.g. <code>(*Example).PointerMethod(e)</code>) shows that the first argument is the receiver.</p>

<p>If that receiver is a pointer, then Go gives that even if it’s nil and that’s fine since it doesn’t get dereferenced (until you dereference it yourself and that panics).</p>

<p>If you try to pass a nil pointer by value, Go will need to dereference it and will panic before having a chance to call your method.</p>

<p>This is why calling a method with a value receiver will trigger a runtime panic.</p>

package main

type Example struct {
	Field int
}

	fmt.Printf(&quot;PointerMethod: %#v (%T)\n&quot;, e, e)
	fmt.Printf(&quot;PointerMethod field access: %#v (%T)\n&quot;, e.Field, e.Field) // this is a runtime panic
}

func (e Example) ValueMethod() {
	fmt.Printf(&quot;ValueMethod: %#v (%T)\n&quot;, e, e)
}

func NewExample() *Example {
	return nil
}

func main() {
	e := NewExample()
	fmt.Printf(&quot;main: %#v (%T)\n&quot;, e, e) // (*main.Example)(nil) (*main.Example)
	e.PointerMethod()                    // this is ok! :mindblown:
	e.ValueMethod()                      // this is a runtime panic
	fmt.Println(e.Field)                 // this is a runtime panic
