<h2 id="factorials">Factorials</h2>

<p>To identify the various combinations of a number or letter, you need to know the number of items.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re dealing with a string like &ldquo;ABC&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s three characters.</p>

<p>So you would say <code>3!</code> factorial.</p>

<p>Which really means: <code>3*2*1 = 6</code>.</p>

<p>And the reason we multiply backwards from <code>3</code> specifically is because there were three characters to begin with.</p>

<p>So we know there are six potential combinations:</p>

<ol>
<li>ABC</li>
<li>ACB</li>
<li>BAC</li>
<li>BCA</li>
<li>CAB</li>
<li>CBA</li>
</ol>

<p>But what if you have 10 items?</p>

<pre><code>10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 3,628,800
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that even with a small number of items, the number of possible combinations becomes very large.</p>

<h2 id="exponents">Exponents</h2>

<p>An exponent is made up of two numbers: a &ldquo;base&rdquo; and a &ldquo;power&rdquo; (also referred to as an &ldquo;exponent&rdquo;, but I prefer &ldquo;power&rdquo; as it helps to distinguish the second number from the over-arching concept of exponents).</p>

<p>Typically the power is displayed as a superscript, but as that not always the easiest thing to type in different editors there is also a symbol to represent an exponent: <code>^</code>.</p>

<pre><code>3^4 = 3*3*3*3
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: strictly speaking the small (superscript) number is the &ldquo;exponent&rdquo;, while the larger number is the &ldquo;base&rdquo;. The base multiplying itself a number times (specifically by whatever number the exponent is set to) will <em>result</em> in what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;raising to the power&rdquo; (the &ldquo;power&rdquo; is the resulting number). &ndash; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation</a></p>
