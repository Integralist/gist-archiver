<p>ECS Task has memory allocation of 500mb.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a multi-process tornado service with 4 processes.</p>

<p>Each process is reporting 200+ mb of RSS (resident) memory usage, which would mean total memory should be larger than 500mb.</p>

<p>But as processes share memory, the total RSS is likely to be the sum of the memory shared across all child processes + the &ldquo;unique&rdquo; memory used by each child process as they diverge from one another.</p>
