<h2 id="sli-slo-sla-1">SLI, SLO, SLA ?</h2>

<p>When building a service, we have a responsibility to define some baseline agreements as to the service’s expected uptime and performance. This document focuses on the various terminology that we use to define these values.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service Level Indicator (SLI)</strong><br />
What the service owner has chosen to measure progress towards their goal.<br />
e.g. What is good/bad service for your users.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Service Level Objective (SLO)</strong><br />
What the service owner’s goal is for the given indicator.<br />
e.g. A percentage that tells how many SLI errors your service can have in a specific period of time.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</strong><br />
What the service owner is promising its users (typically the SLO + wiggle room).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Indicator</strong>: request latency.</li>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: 99.5% of requests will be completed in 5ms.</li>
<li><strong>Agreement</strong>: 99% of requests complete in 5ms or you get a refund.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an alternative example where we state (via a Datadog graph) that if the average request latency over a 1hr period exceeds one second, then we have a ‘service’ issue and it’ll display with a red background. This will signify that we’ve failed our SLA which is defined as being less than one second.</p>

<p>If the average request latency over a 1hr period is greater than half a second, then we have a ‘team’ issue and it’ll display with an orange background. This will signify that we’ve failed our SLO which is defined as being less than half a second.</p>

<p>If the average request latency over a 1hr period is less than half a second, then we have no issues and it’ll display with a green background. This will signify that we’ve reached our SLO which is defined as being less than half a second.</p>
