<pre><code class="language-go">// It's important to realise that you'll only ever want to `go build` or `go run` a single file
// This confused me originally
// I could understand why my task's `Context` didn't get passed the name of the changed file
// The problem was I was just hacking little scripts together
// In practice, you'll be working within a project directory and you'll have a single entry point file

package main

import . &quot;gopkg.in/godo.v1&quot;

func tasks(p *Project) {
	p.Task(&quot;build&quot;, func(c *Context) error {
		return Run(&quot;go build&quot;)
	}).Watch(&quot;**/*.go&quot;)
