<p>Looking back at what I achieved this year&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>I published two books with Apress:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-Vim-Mark-McDonnell/dp/1484202511/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank">Pro Vim</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/tmux-Taster-Mark-McDonnell/dp/1484207769/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1" target="_blank">tmux Taster</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Worked on BBC News Elections and Scottish Referendum back-end architecture and development with JRuby and AWS</li>
<li>Organised public event with <a href="https://twitter.com/sandimetz" target="_blank">Sandi Metz</a> at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/" target="_blank">BBC New Broadcasting House</a>

<ul>
<li>Specifically getting a special thanks from Sandi in her opening story about her parents response to our invitation to speak at the BBC</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Co-designed and built cloud based distributed load test tool with <a href="https://twitter.com/dblooman" target="_blank">David Blooman</a></li>
<li>Co-designed and built a CI workflow around static asset compilation with <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenjack85" target="_blank">Steven Jack</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_arnould" target="_blank">Daniel Arnould</a></li>
<li>Hacking on <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenjack85" target="_blank">Steven Jack</a>&rsquo;s excellent cloud tooling gem (built specifically for BBC)</li>
<li>Having fun understanding the problem space of both concurrency and distributed systems design and implementation</li>
<li>Became technical lead/principal engineer for the BBC News Frameworks team

<ul>
<li>But in reality that means nothing without an unbelievably solid team of extremely talented engineers to help make things happen:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/stevenjack85" target="_blank">Steven Jack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/dan_arnould" target="_blank">Daniel Arnould</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/charlierevett" target="_blank">Charlie Revett</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/dblooman" target="_blank">David Blooman</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Co-designed and built <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/business/markets/europe/lse_ukx" target="_blank">Market Data</a> back-end utilising the <a href="https://github.com/BBC-News/alephant" target="_blank">Alephant Framework</a></li>
<li>Worked on updating the <a href="https://github.com/BBC-News/alephant" target="_blank">Alephant Framework</a> example applications

<ul>
<li>Alephant was originally conceived by the massively talented <a href="https://twitter.com/kenturamon" target="_blank">Robert Kenny</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Working in an environment that (albeit slowly and not entirely perfected - e.g. no automated rollbacks) has reached a state of Continuous Delivery.</li>
<li>Had fun playing with <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenjack85" target="_blank">Steven Jack</a>&rsquo;s great <a href="https://github.com/stevenjack/spurious" target="_blank">Spurious</a> project

<ul>
<li>Spurious is a toolset allowing development against a subset of AWS resources locally</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Co-designed a new version of BBC Newsbeat that is cloud based, distributed and utilising the <a href="https://github.com/BBC-News/alephant" target="_blank">Alephant Framework</a></li>
<li>Won some awards:

<ul>
<li>Best Public Relations of the Year (for my books <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781484202517" target="_blank">Pro Vim</a> and <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781484207765" target="_blank">tmux Taster</a>)</li>
<li>Most innovative use of Technology

<ul>
<li>I accepted this award for the BBC News Frameworks team, but in reality it is shared between both <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenjack85" target="_blank">Steven Jack</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dblooman" target="_blank">David Blooman</a> for their great contributions to tooling built around <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Currently building a Trello to JIRA (and vice-versa) AWS based application to help synchronise data between these two platforms

<ul>
<li>This is likely to be abstracted/generalised into an open-source project at some point in the future (as other organisations may find this type of tool useful)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Very happy to be working within a team that challenges itself to investigate and re-evaluate its stance on specific programming techniques and principles. This is a very encouraging and motivational team and I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of it.</li>
