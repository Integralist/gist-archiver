<pre><code class="language-markdown">Set, included in the stdlib, is an un-ordered collection of elements with no duplicates. However you’ll find that Set’s most useful feature is that its #include? method is much faster than Array’s. In fact Set#include? will always take the same amount of time, regardless of how many elements it contains, whereas Array#include? takes longer the more elements in the array.

Sets do take longer to build than Arrays, so work best when they can be created just once and assigned to a constant, or instance variable of a long lived object.

```ruby
require &quot;set&quot;

TEMP_EMAIL_PROVIDERS = Set[&quot;temp-email.tld&quot;, &quot;throwaway-mail.tld&quot;, ...]

def temporary_email?(address)
  TEMP_EMAIL_PROVIDERS.include?(address.split(&quot;@&quot;).last.downcase)
end
