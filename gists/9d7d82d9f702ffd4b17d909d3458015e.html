<h2 id="adverbs">Adverbs</h2>

<p>An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, noun phrase, clause, preposition, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as how?, in what way?, when?, where?, and to what extent?.</p>

<h3 id="main-verbs">Main Verbs</h3>

<p>Main verbs have meanings related to actions, events and states. Most verbs in English are main verbs:</p>

<ul>
<li>We <strong><em>went</em></strong> home straight after the show.</li>
<li>It <strong><em>snowed</em></strong> a lot that winter.</li>
<li>Several different types of volcano <strong><em>exist</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="linking-verbs">Linking Verbs</h3>

<p>Some main verbs are called linking verbs (or copular verbs). These verbs are not followed by objects. Instead, they are followed by phrases which give extra information about the subject. These include: appear, feel, look, seem, sound, be, get, remain, smell, taste, become.</p>

<ul>
<li>A face <strong><em>appeared</em></strong> <u>at the window</u>. It was Pauline. (prepositional phrase)</li>
<li>He <strong><em>&rsquo;s</em></strong> <u>a cousin of mine</u>. (noun phrase)</li>
<li>This coat <strong><em>feels</em></strong> <u>good</u>. (adjective phrase)</li>
<li>She <strong><em>remained</em></strong> <u>outside</u> while her sister went into the hospital. (adverb phrase)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Also: I <em><strong>am</strong></em> a teacher. I <em><strong>turned</strong></em> green.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the original sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are driving a red car down the road but very slowly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word &ldquo;are&rdquo; is a state/linking verb, and &ldquo;driving&rdquo; is an action verb.</p>

<h3 id="auxiliary-verbs">Auxiliary Verbs</h3>

<p>There are three auxiliary verbs in English: be, do and have. Auxiliary verbs come before main verbs.</p>

<h4 id="auxiliary-be">Auxiliary Be</h4>

<p>Auxiliary be is used to indicate the continuous and the passive voice:</p>

<ul>
<li>I <strong><em>’m waiting</em></strong> for Sally to come home. (continuous)</li>
<li>Her car <strong><em>was stolen</em></strong> from outside her house. (passive)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="auxiliary-do">Auxiliary Do</h4>

<p>Auxiliary do is used in interrogative, negative and emphatic structures:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Does</em></strong> she live locally? (interrogative)</li>
<li>They <strong><em>didn’t</em></strong> know which house it was. (negative)</li>
<li>I <strong><em>do</em></strong> like your new laptop! (emphatic, with spoken stress on do)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="auxiliary-have">Auxiliary Have</h4>

<p>Auxiliary have is used to indicate the perfect:</p>

<ul>
<li>I <strong><em>&rsquo;ve lost</em></strong> my memory stick. <strong><em>Have</em></strong> you <strong><em>seen</em></strong> it anywhere? (present perfect)</li>
<li>She <strong><em>had seen</em></strong> my car outside the shop. (past perfect)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="modal-verbs">Modal Verbs</h3>

<p>Modal verbs have meanings connected with degrees of certainty and necessity, such as: can, may, must, should, would, could, might, shall, will.</p>

<ul>
<li>We <strong><em>&rsquo;ll</em></strong> be there around 7.30. (speaker is quite certain)</li>
<li>A new window <strong><em>could</em></strong> cost around £500. (speaker is less certain)</li>
<li>I <strong><em>must</em></strong> ring the tax office. (speaker considers this very necessary)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="present-tense">Present Tense</h2>

<h3 id="continous">Continous</h3>

<p>There are some similarities between state/linking verbs and what is known as &lsquo;Present Continous Tense&rsquo;, which is a means of describing a <em>subject</em> along with a <em>present tense</em> for the verb to be. For example, &ldquo;I am swimming&rdquo; (&ldquo;I&rdquo; is the subject, &ldquo;am&rdquo; is the present tense for the verb to be, and &ldquo;swimming&rdquo; is the present verb).</p>

<p>There are other forms of present continuous tense (verb tense is italicized):</p>

<ul>
<li>She <em>is crying</em>.</li>
<li>We <em>are visiting</em> the museum in the afternoon.</li>
<li>You <em>are not watching</em> the movie.</li>
</ul>

<p>It can also indicate if something will or will not happen in the near <em>future</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>She <em>is not going</em> to the game tonight.</li>
<li><em>Are</em> you <em>visiting</em> your cousin this weekend?</li>
<li>I <em>am not going</em> to the meeting after work.</li>
<li><em>Is</em> John <em>playing</em> football today?</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="perfect">Perfect</h3>

<p>The present tense (i.e. not continuous) is a means of describing an event that happened in the past that has present consequences.</p>

<ul>
<li>She <em>has lived</em> here all her life.</li>
<li>He has finished his homework (<em>has done</em>).</li>
<li>I <em>have worked</em> here since I graduated school.</li>
</ul>

<p>Present perfect tense can be used with expressions that are unspecific in time:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have lost my purse.</li>
<li>We have seen this movie already.</li>
<li>He has broken his leg.</li>
<li>There has been an accident.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inflection">Inflection</h2>

<p>Inflection is the name for the extra letter or letters added to nouns, verbs and adjectives in their different grammatical forms. Nouns are inflected in the plural, verbs are inflected in the various tenses, and adjectives are inflected in the comparative/superlative.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li>bus → buses<br />
</li>
<li>wish → wishes</li>
<li>easy → easiest</li>
<li>carry → carrying</li>
<li>play → played</li>
<li>die → dying</li>
<li>stop → stopped</li>
<li>happen → happening</li>
</ul>
