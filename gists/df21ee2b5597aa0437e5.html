<h2 id="ruby-threads-failing-fast-md">Ruby Threads: failing fast.md</h2>

<p>In our code base we spin up some Threads&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-rb">metas.map do |meta|
  Thread.new do
    fetch(meta, timeout)
  end
end.map(&amp;:value)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>fetch</code> function will call some code from within another class which itself internally will throw and catch lots of exceptions.</p>

<p>In one instance it&rsquo;ll throw an exception that isn&rsquo;t caught by the class, and so it bubbles up to the top level of the application.</p>

<p>The issue is that although the exception is thrown and is <em>eventually</em> rescued by a function in the top level of the application, the current code takes far too long to get there. The reason being: our loop keeps going - regardless of the unhandled exception - until all the other threads have finished (so we <strong>DON&rsquo;T</strong> &ldquo;fail fast&rdquo; in this scenario).</p>

<p>The following code replicates this behaviour and then tries to solve it&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="ruby-threads-failing-fast-rb">Ruby Threads: failing fast.rb</h2>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"># SETUP...

class ::FooError &lt; StandardError
  def initialize(msg)
    super &quot;msg: #{msg}&quot;
  end
end

class ::BarError &lt; StandardError
  def initialize(msg)
    super &quot;msg: #{msg}&quot;
  end
end

def foo(i)
  sleep i; fail ::FooError.new(&quot;new foo error&quot;)
rescue ::FooError =&gt; e
  e
end

def bar(i)
  sleep i; fail ::BarError.new(&quot;new bar error&quot;) 
  # to see a full length run through, change this to... 
  # sleep i; &quot;some success value&quot;
end

# ACTUAL SOLUTION...

start = Time.now

times = [10, 10, 2].map do |i|
  Thread.new do
    begin
      if i == 2
        bar(i) # run bar with 2 second sleep
      else
        foo(i) # run foo with 10 second sleep
      end
    rescue
      Thread.new { check(times) }
      Thread.kill(Thread.current)
    end
  end
end

def check(threads)
  threads.select { |t| t unless t.alive? }.tap do |result|
    threads.each { |t| t.kill } if result.size &gt; 0
  end
end

p times.map { |i| i.value }

finish = Time.now - start

p finish # should be ~2 seconds, definitely not 10! unless you modify the code as indicated above
