  In order to &lt;do something&gt;
  As a &lt;user&gt;
  I want to &lt;achieve some goal&gt;

  Scenario: &lt;title&gt;
  
    &lt;additional description&gt;
  
    Given &lt;some state&gt;
    When &lt;some action&gt;
    Then &lt;some expectation&gt; with &lt;some_name&gt; # where &lt;some_name&gt; is actual Gherkin syntax for a table lookup!

    Examples:
      | some_name |
      | A         |
      | B         |
      | C         |
      | ...etc    |

  Tasks: # non-standard syntax, but useful for most 'project planning' purposes

<pre><code class="language-gherkin">Feature: Resilience

  In order to provide content to our users
  As an organisation
  We want our websites/apps and their dependencies to be available

  Scenario: Fastly Unavailable

    Fastly is our CDN provider, and is effectively the 'front door' to the
    majority of our publicly consumed content.

    Given Fastly is unavailable
    When a user requests a public buzzfeed resource (e.g. www.buzzfeed.com)
    Then we expect the resource to be provided

  Tasks:

    - What: Investigation of 'stale rendering' vs 'multi-region infrastructure'
      Why: Understand the risk/cost implications of each approach.
      Impact: We'll be able to proceed with the approach which provides the most value.

    - What: Migration of CDN logic to Perimeter.
      Why: We want to reduce the amount of unfamilar code.
      Impact: Will make migrating to an alternative CDN provider easier as there is less logic coupling.

<pre><code class="language-gherkin">Feature: Restaurant

  Scenario Outline: eating

    Given there are &lt;start&gt; cucumbers
    When I eat &lt;eat&gt; cucumbers
    Then I should have &lt;left&gt; cucumbers

    Examples:
      | start | eat | left |
      |    12 |   5 |    7 |
      |    20 |   5 |   15 |
