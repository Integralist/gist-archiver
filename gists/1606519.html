<pre><code class="language-markdown">Mozilla Thunderbird tries to copy emails you write into a Sent folder.

But when setting up a custom IMAP email account in Thunderbird it had failed to create a `Sent` folder and so when I sent an email the software would hang as there was no folder to copy the sent email into.

I also couldn't create a `Sent` folder either, it wouldn't error, it just wouldn't display the folder I tried to add?

The solution is to create all folders with the prefix `INBOX.` (that's including the period character)

so `INBOX.Sent` and that created a `Sent` folder for me.
