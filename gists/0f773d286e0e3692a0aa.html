<p><strong>Imperative programming</strong>:<br />
Telling the &ldquo;machine&rdquo; <strong><em>how</em></strong> to do something, and as a result what you want to happen will happen.<br />
Go is imperative in nature as some common language abstractions (e.g. <code>Array#map</code>) are absent and encourages an explicit imperative programming style.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm" target="_blank">Procedural programming</a> is derived from &lsquo;imperative&rsquo; programming and is named as such because it groups instructions into &lsquo;procedures&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Declarative programming</strong>:<br />
Telling the &ldquo;machine&rdquo; what you would like to happen, and let the computer figure out how to do it.<br />
Functional Programming and its abstractions (e.g. <code>Array#map</code> instead of <code>for</code>) allow you to focus on <strong><em>what</em></strong> we want to happen rather than <strong><em>how</em></strong> to iterate the object.</p>

<p><strong>Structured programming</strong>:<br />
Makes extensive use of subroutines, block structures, <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops.<br />
Object-Oriented Programming is an extension of this.</p>
