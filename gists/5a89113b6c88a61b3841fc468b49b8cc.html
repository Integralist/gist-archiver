So how do we identify large numbers?

The &quot;trick&quot; is to always group the digits in threes from right to left, starting with the smallest unit (ones). 

**Here's how it works:**

- If the number has more than three digits, you add commas every three digits as you move left.
- If the number has three digits or fewer, there’s no need for commas since it’s already easy to read.

**Examples:**

- 123 → No comma needed, already 3 digits
  - i.e. one hundred and twenty three.
  - The 1 is 'hundreds', 2 is 'tens', 3 is 'ones'.

- 1,234 → Four digits, so we group into 1,234.
  - i.e. one thousand, two hundred and thirty four.
  - The 1 is 'thousands', 2 is 'hundreds', 3 is 'tens', 4 is 'ones'.
  
- 12,345 → Five digits, so we group into 12,345.
  - i.e. twelve thousand, three hundred and fourty five.
  - The 12 is 'thousands', 3 is 'hundreds', 4 is 'tens', 5 is 'ones'.

- 123,456 → Six digits, grouped as 123,456.
  - i.e. one hound and twenty three thousand, four hundred and fifty six.
  - The 123 is 'thousands', 4 is 'hundreds', 5 is 'tens', 6 is 'ones'.

- 1,234,567 → Seven digits, grouped as 1,234,567.
  - i.e. one million, two hundred and thirty four thousand, five hundred and sixty seven.
  - The 1 is 'millions', 234 is 'thousands', 5 is 'hundreds', 6 is 'tens', 7 is 'ones'.
