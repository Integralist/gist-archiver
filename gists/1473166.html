<h2 id="facebook-md">facebook.md</h2>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">* Register for a 'business' account (https://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php)
* Register for normal account (https://www.facebook.com/)
* Login with business account and install Developer app (http://facebook.com/developers)
* Set normal account to be the 'administrator' for your business account/page
* Login with normal account and create an app (as per normal routine... https://developers.facebook.com/apps)

The problem from here is that there is no way (in my experience) once you've created the app to click on 'View App Profile Page &gt; Add to My Page' (as suggested in all the tutorials - the link just doesn't exist!)

The solution is to go to the following URL and change APP_ID and URL_TO_HOSTED_CONTENT

https://www.facebook.com/dialog/pagetab?app_id=APP_ID&amp;next=URL_TO_HOSTED_CONTENT

...this will then allow you to add the app you created to any page you 'administer'
