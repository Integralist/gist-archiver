<h1 id="rules-for-good-testing">Rules for good testing</h1>

<p>Look at the following image&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="https://speakerd.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/ac751bc0918e01300e0b6698bdce82b7/slide_29.jpg?1367359730" alt="" /></p>

<p>&hellip;it shows an object being tested.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t see inside the object. All you can do is send it messages. This is an important point to make because we should be &ldquo;testing the interface, and NOT the implementation&rdquo; - doing so will allow us to change the implementation without causing our tests to break.</p>

<p>Messages can go &lsquo;into&rsquo; an object and can be sent &lsquo;out&rsquo; from an object (as you can see from the image above, there are messages going in as well as messages going out). That&rsquo;s fine, that&rsquo;s how objects communicate.</p>

<p>Now there are two types of messages: &lsquo;query&rsquo; and &lsquo;command&rsquo;&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="queries">Queries</h2>

<p>Queries are messages that &ldquo;return something&rdquo; and &ldquo;change nothing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In programming terms they are &ldquo;getters&rdquo; and not &ldquo;setters&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>

<p>Commands are messages that &ldquo;return nothing&rdquo; and &ldquo;change something&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In programming terms they are &ldquo;setters&rdquo; and not &ldquo;getters&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-test">What to test?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Test incoming query messages by making assertions about what they send back</li>
<li>Test incoming command messages by making assertions about direct public side effects</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-not-to-test">What NOT to test?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Messages that are sent from within the object itself (e.g. private methods).</li>
<li>Outgoing query messages (as they have no public side effects)</li>
<li>Outgoing command messages (use mocks and set expectations on behaviour to ensure rest of your code pass without error)</li>
<li>Incoming messages that have no dependants (just remove those tests)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: there is no point in testing outgoing messages because they should be tested as incoming messages on another object</p>

<h2 id="what-to-mock-stub">What to Mock/Stub</h2>

<p>Command messages should be mocked, while query messages should be stubbed</p>

<h2 id="contract-tests">Contract Tests</h2>

<p>Contract tests exist to ensure a specific &lsquo;role&rsquo; (or &lsquo;interface&rsquo; by another - stricter - name) actually presents an API that we expect.</p>

<p>These types of tests can be useful to ensure third party APIs do (or don&rsquo;t) cause our code to break when we update the version of the software.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: if the libraries we use follow <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a> then this should only happen when we do a major version upgrade. But it&rsquo;s still good to have contract/role/interface tests in place to catch any problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following is a modified example (written in Ruby) borrowed from the book &ldquo;Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"># Following test asserts that SomeObject (@some_object) 
# implements the method `some_x_interface_method`
module SomeObjectInterfaceTest
  def test_object_implements_the_x_interface
    assert_respond_to(@some_object, :some_x_interface_method)
  end
end

# Following test proves that Foobar implements the SomeObject role correctly
# i.e. Foobar implements the SomeObject interface
class FoobarTest &lt; MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  include SomeObjectInterfaceTest

  def setup
    @foobar = @some_object = Foobar.new
  end

  # ...other tests...
end
