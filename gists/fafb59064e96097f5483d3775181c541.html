<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Unit test

Specify and test one point of the contract of single method of a class. This should have a very narrow and well defined scope. Complex dependencies and interactions to the outside world are stubbed or mocked.

## Integration test

Test the correct inter-operation of multiple subsystems. There is whole spectrum there, from testing integration between two classes, to testing integration with the production environment.

## Acceptance test

Test that a feature or use case is correctly implemented. It is similar to an integration test, but with a focus on the use case to provide rather than on the components involved.

## Smoke test

A simple integration test where we just check that when the system under test is invoked it returns normally and does not blow up.

Also known as a &quot;sanity check&quot;.

## Regression test

A test that was written when a bug was fixed. It ensures that this specific bug will not occur again. The full name is &quot;non-regression test&quot;. It can also be a test made prior to changing an application to make sure the application provides the same outcome.
