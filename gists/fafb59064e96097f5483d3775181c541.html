<h2 id="unit-test">Unit test</h2>

<p>Specify and test one point of the contract of single method of a class. This should have a very narrow and well defined scope. Complex dependencies and interactions to the outside world are stubbed or mocked.</p>

<h2 id="integration-test">Integration test</h2>

<p>Test the correct inter-operation of multiple subsystems. There is whole spectrum there, from testing integration between two classes, to testing integration with the production environment.</p>

<h2 id="acceptance-test">Acceptance test</h2>

<p>Test that a feature or use case is correctly implemented. It is similar to an integration test, but with a focus on the use case to provide rather than on the components involved.</p>

<h2 id="smoke-test">Smoke test</h2>

<p>A simple integration test where we just check that when the system under test is invoked it returns normally and does not blow up.</p>

<p>Also known as a &ldquo;sanity check&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="regression-test">Regression test</h2>

<p>A test that was written when a bug was fixed. It ensures that this specific bug will not occur again. The full name is &ldquo;non-regression test&rdquo;. It can also be a test made prior to changing an application to make sure the application provides the same outcome.</p>
