<h1 id="clojure-s-thread-first-and-thread-last-macros">Clojure&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thread First&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thread Last&rdquo; macros</h1>

<h2 id="macros-md">Macros.md</h2>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">In Clojure macros are executed *before* code is evaluated. Macros allow us to manipulate the program being compiled. There are two macros in particular that I like to demonstrate why this is useful:

- Thread First `-&gt;`
- Thread Last `-&gt;&gt;`

&gt; Note: in Clojure sequence data structures (lists &amp; vectors) are usually the last item in an argument list; where as map data structures are usually the first argument in an argument list

## Thread First

Our original program requires us to effectively read it &quot;inside out&quot;:

```clj
(dissoc
  (assoc 
    {:name &quot;Jonathan&quot; :password &quot;secret&quot;} 
    :nickname &quot;Jon&quot;) 
  :password)

; =&gt; {:nickname &quot;Jon&quot;, :name &quot;Jonathan&quot;}
</code></pre>

<p>But as humans we prefer to read things the other way around (this is where Thread First can help):</p>

<pre><code class="language-clj">(-&gt; {:name &quot;Jonathan&quot; :password &quot;secret&quot;}
    (assoc :nickname &quot;Jon&quot;)
    (dissoc :password))

; =&gt; {:nickname &quot;Jon&quot;, :name &quot;Jonathan&quot;} 
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we&rsquo;re telling it to pass the map data structure as the first argument to each of the subsequent lists to be processed. This allows us to read the code in a more natural flow. But as macros are run <em>before</em> code is evaluated, Clojure will receive it in its original form and evaluate that original code.</p>

<h2 id="thread-last">Thread Last</h2>

<p>This macro works the same way but for sequences (see the <code>Note</code> above).</p>

<pre><code class="language-clj">(reduce + (filter odd? (map inc (range 10))))

; you can write it long form if you prefer:
(reduce + 
  (filter odd? 
    (map inc 
      (range 10))))

; =&gt; 25
</code></pre>

<p>And now rewritten in a more natural flow&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-clj">(-&gt;&gt; (range 10) (map inc) (filter odd?) (reduce +))

; you can write it long form if you prefer:
(-&gt;&gt; (range 10)
     (map inc)
     (filter odd?)
     (reduce +))

; =&gt; 25
</code></pre>

<p>&rdquo;`</p>
