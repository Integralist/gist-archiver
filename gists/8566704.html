# until a threadâ€™s execution is complete before continuing.
# In this way, you make sure all the threads are complete
# before exiting.
threads.each { |thread| thread.join }

# We can provide a timeout for our threads
# Below is a one second timeout
# thread.join(1)

# Thread.list holds a global list of threads
# Thread.list includes Thread.main
# Thread.current is the currently executing thread
# Thread.stop only pauses the thread (t.status == 'sleep')
# Thread.run resumes a stopped thread
# Thread.kill(thread) causes that thread to exit
# Thread.exit
# Thread.pass passes control to another thread
# Thread.abort_on_exception = true (all threads will abort)
# t.value is the returned value from a finished thread
