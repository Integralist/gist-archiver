<title>The last time I wrote any real PHP (of any production worth) was back in 2006 (it's now December 2012). I thought I would share some potentially terrible PHP code I wrote today whilst trying to refresh my memory. Definitely feel free to have a good laugh, but what would be even better would be some constructive criticism. This isn't supposed to be anything remotely near finished code. The purpose was to get me back into the feel for writing PHP. If there are suggestions about what I've written (things I should avoid for example) then I'd love to hear them. Thanks!</title>
