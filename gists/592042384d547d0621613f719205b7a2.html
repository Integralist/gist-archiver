<pre><code class="language-markdown">Use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to allow each of your projects to have their own set of dependencies. This is similar to how Ruby has Bundler and Gemfiles so you don't install certain packages globally.

- `sudo pip install virtualenv` (installs it globally; ironic I know but this is OK)
- `virtualenv env` (`env` is the dir that'll be created; this name is common practice)

Avoid commiting `env` into version control by utilising `.gitignore`

&gt; `virtualenv .` side-steps the folder creation if you really prefer

Now you can install packages using:

- `env/bin/pip install &lt;package&gt;`

To run the Python binary you don't use the system version; instead:

- `env/bin/python &lt;...&gt;`

If you don't like typing, you can shorten the `env/bin` so it becomes part of your shell's environment:

- `source env/bin/activate`

To demonstrate:

- `which python` = `/usr/bin/python`
- `source env/bin/activate`
- `which python` = `~/Projects/python/foo-project/env/bin/python`

&gt; Use `deactivate` whenever using the same shell to swith between projects

### Switching Python versions

So `virtualenv` will use the default Python version installed (for me it was `2.7.10`).

To switch it to using Python 3, execute the following:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 &lt;env&gt;
</code></pre>
