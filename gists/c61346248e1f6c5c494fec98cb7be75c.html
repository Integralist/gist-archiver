<pre><code class="language-markdown">A file can be accessed by different user types:

- Owner
- Group
- Other

Any one of these groups might be allowed to:

- Read (`r`)
- Write (`w`)
- Execute (`x`)

These typically are displayed with a hyphen followed by the permissions for the user type (e.g. `-rwx-rwx-rwx`):

</code></pre>

<p>$ ls -l</p>

<p>-rw-r&ndash;r&ndash;  1 integralist  staff      2  5 Feb 11:08 foo.txt</p>

<pre><code>
&gt; Note: in the above example the 'owner' can read/write, while the 'group' and 'other' users can only read the file.

To set these permissions you can use `chmod` with a 'octal permission' value:

</code></pre>

<p>chmod 777 foo.txt</p>

<pre><code>
&gt; Note: this would mean all user types (owner, group, other) can all read/write/execute the file.

So what do these octal numbers mean?

</code></pre>

<p>x (execute) - 1
w (write)   - 2
r (read)    - 4</p>

<pre><code>
We need to combine these numbers for _each_ user type:

To have read and write permissions would require a value of `6` (e.g. `2 (write) + 4 (read) = 6`).

If we only wanted the owner to have both read and write, but the others can only read the file, then we'd use:

</code></pre>

<p>chmod 644 foo.txt</p>

<pre><code>
Because `6` == read/write for owner, while `4` == read for group/other.
</code></pre>
